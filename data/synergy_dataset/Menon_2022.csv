https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bjps.2020.05.035,Is there a therapeutic effect of botulinum toxin on scalp alopecia? Physiopathology and reported cases: A systematic review of the literature,"Botulinum toxin is a treatment whose effectiveness has been widely demonstrated in the treatment of facial wrinkles. Its use in alopecia has been much less studied in the literature. Therefore, we carried out a systematic review of the literature in December 2019 in order to index published cases of alopecia patients treated with botulinum toxin. Pub Med, Embase, and Cochrane Library databases were explored. Six studies that included 94 patients were selected. Only one study was prospectively controlled against placebo. Of the 94 patients, 85 were affected by androgenetic alopecia, 8 by alopecia areata, and 1 by radiation-induced alopecia. The doses injected per session varied between 30 and 150 units and the number of sessions between 1 and 12. In the majority of the studies, the injections were carried out in all the muscles of the scalp (frontal, temporal, peri-auricular, occipital). Four studies showed a frank improvement in hair growth. Two of them showed improvement in hair density using an objective endpoint (hair count). The remaining reported studies showed inconclusive results. Patient satisfaction was high across all studies, but this systematic review did not clearly demonstrate the value of using the botulinum toxin in the treatment of alopecia. Subsequent prospective randomized controlled studies are required.",0

Potentially eligible studies were identified from Medline and EMBASE databases from inception to March 2020 using a search strategy that consisted of terms for “Klotho” and “Mortality”. Eligible study must be a cohort study that consists of one cohort of CKD patients with higher circulating soluble Klotho level and another cohort of CKD patients with lower circulating soluble Klotho level. The study must also report relative risk (RR), incidence rate ratio, hazard risk ratio or standardized incidence ratio with 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) comparing all-cause mortality between CKD patients with lower circulating soluble Klotho level versus CKD patients with higher circulating soluble Klotho level. If the study divides patients (per circulating soluble Klotho level) into more than two groups, a comparison between the highest and the lowest group would be extracted. Point estimates with standard errors were retrieved from each study and were combined together using the generic inverse variance method. A total of 2964 articles were retrieved. After two rounds of an independent review by two investigators, six prospective cohort studies met the eligibility criteria and were included into the meta-analysis. CKD patients with lower circulating soluble Klotho level had a significantly increased risk of all-cause mortality with the pooled risk ratio of 1.88 (95% CI 1.29–2.74; I2 0%). The funnel plot was fairly symmetric and did not reveal any suggestive evidence of publication bias. The current study found a significant association between lower circulating soluble Klotho level and increased risk of all-cause mortality in CKD patients. However, this meta-analysis carries some limitations, including relatively small sample size, lack of adjustment for potential confounders and between-study heterogeneity in baseline characteristics of the patients and cut-off values used to categorize patients into higher and lower circulating serum Klotho level group.",0
https://doi.org/10.1111/zph.12698,A systematic review and meta‐analysis of predictors of human hepatitis E virus exposure in non‐endemic countries,"The reported incidence of clinical hepatitis E cases is rising in some non-endemic countries, with concurrent concerns regarding potential hepatitis E virus (HEV) contamination of the blood supply. Therefore, the characterization of major potential sources of human HEV exposure is important to inform risk assessment and public health policy. A systematic review was conducted, including a comprehensive search in six electronic bibliographic databases, verified by hand-searching reference lists of HEV reviews, and a grey literature search, of the broad research question 'what is the evidence of the association between predictors of human HEV exposure, and HEV IgG seropositivity, in non-endemic countries?' Using forms designed a priori, captured studies were appraised at first-level screening, second-level characterization, and third-level data extraction and risk of bias assessment. Meta-analysis yielded summary estimates of association between potential predictors and odds of HEV seropositivity. Meta-analysis and meta-regression of the odds of HEV seroprevalence in specific groups characterized potential sources of HEV exposure. From 4,163 captured citations, 245 relevant studies underwent data extraction, investigating HEV seroprevalence or predictors in both healthy subjects and targeted patient groups. Across these groups, increasing age was a predictor of HEV IgG seropositivity. Both human immunodeficiency virus patients and haemodialysis patients had significantly increased odds of HEV seropositivity relative to the general population. Working with pigs, in forestry, or in hospitals, was significantly associated with increased odds of HEV seropositivity, as were consumption of meat, pork or game meat, or hunting. Chronological time was not associated with HEV seropositivity within our data sets. Further study of the distribution of potential dietary or behavioural predictors between high and lower prevalence areas within non-endemic countries could improve our understanding of the relative importance of specific HEV transmission pathways.",0

Methods The relevant randomized controlled trials were retrieved from PubMed and the Cochrane Library. Network meta-analyses were used to compare multiple drugs simultaneously for the outcomes of nmCRPC. Direct evidence in trials and indirect evidence across trials were combined by the network meta-analyses to estimate the treatment efficiency. Outcome Eight studies were included in our research. For prostate-specific antigen progression-free survival, the rate of progression was significantly decreased following apalutamide, enzalutamide, bicalutamide+dutasteride, and bicalutamide treatment compared with placebo. Compared with placebo treatment, metastases-free survival was significantly increased in patients who received apalutamide (hazard ratio [HR]: 0.28, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.23-0.35), enzalutamide (HR: 0.29, 95% CI: 0.24-0.35), and darolutamide (HR: 0.42, 95% CI: 0.35-0.50). Direct comparison showed significant survival benefits in patients who received second-generation anti-androgen therapy (apalutamide, enzalutamide, and darolutamide: HR: 0.74, 95% CI: 0.61-0.91) compared with patients who received placebo. With respect to metastases-free survival, based on SUCRA analysis, there was 80% and 78% probability that apalutamide and enzalutamide were preferred treatment, while darolutamide was likely to be second-best choice. Compared with placebo, all agents were not associated with significantly higher likelihood of serious adverse events and grade 3 to 4 adverse events. Conclusion Our outcomes support equivalent efficacy and similar risk of adverse effects between apalutamide, enzalutamide, and darolutamide, supporting the use of these antiandrogen agents in high-risk of progression nmCRPC.",0

Chemoradiation (CRT) is the current standard treatment for locally advanced cervical cancer, without specific treatment modifications based on HIV status. This systematic review evaluates existing literature reporting differences in outcomes between HIV+ and HIV– women with invasive cervical cancer treated with CRT. <h3>Methods and Materials</h3> Searches were conducted through Pubmed, Ovid MEDLINE, Embase, Scopus, Web of Science, and Cochrane Library. Two researchers independently conducted article selection; articles were selected by title, then abstract, and then by full text content. Data were extracted using a structured form. <h3>Results</h3> Thirteen articles were included in the analysis, all of which were either retrospective or prospective cohort studies published between 2012 and 2018, and most of which were conducted in Sub-Saharan Africa. Treatment outcomes included treatment response, survival, toxicities, and quality of life. The majority of studies (8 of 13) reported no differences in treatment outcomes by HIV status. Out of 8 studies that assessed survival, 6 reported no significant difference based on HIV status. All 4 studies assessing treatment response found no significant differences based on HIV status. Among 6 studies primarily assessing treatment toxicity, 3 showed no differences based on HIV status. Factors affecting treatment outcomes, such as treatment selection bias, pretreatment hemoglobin levels, and antiretroviral therapy administration, were not systematically accounted for. <h3>Conclusions</h3> The majority of studies analyzed showed no differences in treatment outcomes, including overall toxicity, treatment response, or mortality, on the basis of HIV infection status. These results suggest CRT should continue to be the treatment of choice for locally invasive cervical cancer regardless of HIV status. Further study is required to more precisely account for other variables that influence treatment outcome.",0

We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to assess the efficacy of ALK inhibitors compared to chemotherapy (ALK vs. chemo) and 2nd generation ALK inhibitors compared to 1 st generation ALK inhibitors (ALK-2 G vs. ALK-1 G). Methods The electronic databases Medline (PubMed), EMBASE, and the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews were searched for relevant randomized trials. Pooled hazard ratios (HR) for OS and progression free survival (PFS), and pooled risk ratios for objective response rates (ORR) and toxicity were meta-analyzed using the generic inverse variance and the Mantel-Haenszel methods. To account for between-studies heterogeneity, random-effect models were used. Subgroup analyses compared PFS by gender, smoking status, brain metastases, race and age. Results Six trials were included in the analysis of ALK vs. chemo and four in the analysis of ALK-2 G vs. ALK-1 G. Treatment with ALK inhibitors improved OS compared to chemotherapy (HR: 0.84, 95 %CI 0.72−0.97) while a trend toward a better OS was seen with ALK-2 G vs. ALK-1 G (HR: 0.66, 95 %CI 0.43–1.02). PFS was improved with ALK vs. chemo and ALK-2 G vs. ALK-1 G (HR: 0.44, 95 %CI 0.35−0.54 and HR: 0.38, 95 %CI-0.29−0.51, respectively). ORR was improved with ALK vs. chemo and ALK-2 G vs. ALK-1 G. No difference in toxicity was observed. Conclusions This meta-analysis is the first, to our knowledge, to report an OS and PFS benefit with the use of ALK inhibitors compared to chemotherapy from randomized trial data. A trend toward a better OS was also seen with ALK-2 G vs. ALK-1 G and this is likely because of crossover effects and limited OS follow-up. Longer follow up and further research are warranted to directly compare ALK inhibitor sequences and to understand the outcomes of second generation ALK inhibitors as initial therapy.",0

https://doi.org/10.1016/j.joca.2019.09.008,The effects of TNF-alpha inhibition on cartilage: a systematic review of preclinical studies,"Summary Objective To report the most up-to-date evidence on the effects of tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha inhibition on cartilage with a focus on its clinical relevance. Design A systematic review was performed by searching PubMed, Embase and Cochrane Library databases. Inclusion criteria were studies of any level of evidence published in peer-reviewed journals reporting clinical or preclinical results written in English. Relative data were extracted and critically analysed. PRISMA guidelines were applied, and risk of bias was assessed as well as the methodological quality of the included studies. Results 13 studies were included after applying the inclusion and exclusion criteria. Three were in vitro human studies from osteoarthritis (OA) patients. Ten were animal modal studies including two in vitro studies, and eight in vivo studies. TNF-alpha inhibition in in vitro studies was generally reported beneficial due to the improved osteochondral viability, proliferation and chondrogenesis. In addition, TNF-alpha inhibition was noted to be beneficial in promoting the natural repair of osteochondral lesions and has a chondroprotective effect in in vivo studies. Conclusion Based on current evidence, TNF might have the potential to interfere with the healing process of chondral and osteochondral defects occurring naturally or in low inflammatory environment after a cartilage repair procedure. Therefore, the use of biological agents to inhibit its action in cartilage repair surgery could be beneficial, and this could translate into a promising therapy that improves the outcome of currently available cartilage procedures.",0

Hospital environments can be particularly confusing and challenging for people living with dementia (Plwd) impacting their wellbeing and the ability to optimize their care. Improving the experience of care in hospital has been recognized as a priority, and non-pharmacological interventions including activity interventions have been associated with improved wellbeing and behavioral outcomes for Plwd in other settings. This systematic review aimed at evaluating the effectiveness of activity interventions to improve experience of care for Plwd in hospital. Methods Systematic searches were conducted in 16 electronic databases up to October 2019. Reference lists of included studies and forward citation searching were also conducted. Quantitative studies reporting comparative data for activity interventions delivered to Plwd aiming to improve their experience of care in hospital were included. Screening for inclusion, data extraction and quality appraisal were performed independently by two reviewers with discrepancies resolved by discussion with a third where necessary. Standardized mean differences (SMDs) were calculated where possible to support narrative statements and aid interpretation. Results Six studies met the inclusion criteria (one randomized and five non-randomized uncontrolled studies) including 216 Plwd. Activity interventions evaluated music, art, social, psychotherapeutic, and combinations of tailored activities in relation to wellbeing outcomes. Although studies were generally underpowered, findings indicated beneficial effects of activity interventions with improved mood and engagement of Plwd while in hospital, and reduced levels of responsive behaviors. Calculated SMDs ranged from very small to large but were mostly statistically non-significant. Conclusions The small number of identified studies indicate that activity-based interventions implemented in hospitals may be effective in improving aspects of the care experience for Plwd. Larger well-conducted studies are needed to fully evaluate the potential of this type of non-pharmacological intervention to improve experience of care in hospital settings, and whether any benefits extend to staff wellbeing and the wider ward environment.",0
https://doi.org/10.1634/theoncologist.2019-0615,A Systematic Review of Pediatric Phase I Trials in Oncology: Toxicity and Outcomes in the Era of Targeted Therapies,"Abstract Background Pediatric phase I oncology trials have historically focused on safety and toxicity, with objective response rates (ORRs) &amp;lt;10%. Recently, with an emphasis on targeted approaches, response rates may have changed. We analyzed outcomes of recent phase I pediatric oncology trials. Materials and Methods This was a systematic review of phase I pediatric oncology trials published in 2012–2017, identified through PubMed and EMBASE searches conducted on March 14, 2018. Selection criteria included full-text articles with a pediatric population, cancer diagnosis, and a dose escalation schema. Each publication was evaluated for patient characteristics, therapy type, trial design, toxicity, and response. Results Of 3,431 citations, 109 studies (2,713 patients) met eligibility criteria. Of these, 78 (72%) trials incorporated targeted therapies. Median age at enrollment/trial was 11 years (range 3–21 years). There were 2,471 patients (91%) evaluable for toxicity, of whom 300 (12.1%) experienced dose-limiting toxicity (DLT). Of 2,143 patients evaluable for response, 327 (15.3%) demonstrated an objective response. Forty-three (39%) trials had no objective responses. Nineteen trials (17%) had an ORR &amp;gt;25%, of which 11 were targeted trials and 8 were combination cytotoxic trials. Targeted trials demonstrated a lower DLT rate compared with cytotoxic trials (10.6% vs. 14.7%; p = .003) with similar ORRs (15.0% vs. 15.9%; p = .58). Conclusion Pediatric oncology phase I trials in the current treatment era have an acceptable DLT rate and a pooled ORR of 15.3%. A subset of trials with target-specific enrollment or combination cytotoxic therapies showed high response rates, highlighting the importance of these strategies in early phase trials. Implications for Practice Enrollment in phase I oncology trials is crucial for development of novel therapies. This systematic review of phase I pediatric oncology trials provides an assessment of outcomes of phase I trials in children, with a specific focus on the impact of targeted therapies. These data may aid in evaluating the landscape of current phase I options for patients and enable more informed communication regarding risk and benefit of phase I clinical trial participation. The results also suggest that, in the current treatment era, there is a rationale to increase earlier access to targeted therapy trials for this refractory patient population.",0

We searched the Medline database via PubMed and Ovid using the keywords of ""Candida tropicalis"" combined with ""outbreak"" or ""clustering"" or ""clusters,"" and we limited the search to studies conducted from January 1989 to January 2019.We report two related cases of C tropicalis candidemia among patients with AML following a period of neutropenia, who had erythematous skin rash as a first manifesting sign of candidiasis. C tropicalis was isolated from blood and skin cultures of both patients, which were identical by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis typing. Our systematic review of outbreaks caused by C tropicalis suggests that (a) most reported outbreaks have occurred in neonatal and adult ICUs; (b) patients who receive total parenteral therapy, antibiotics and those who have indwelling catheters and recent surgery are at high risk of infection; and (c) environmental and healthcare personnel surveillance suggest that cross-contamination is a major risk factor.Control of nosocomial outbreaks caused by C tropicalis should include better infection control measures, education of healthcare professionals especially working in adult and neonatal intensive care and haematology units.",0
https://doi.org/10.1111/opn.12325,The experiences of hospital staff who provide care for people living with dementia: A systematic review and synthesis of qualitative studies,"Aims and objectives To systematically review and synthesise qualitative data from studies exploring the experiences of hospital staff who care for people living with dementia (Plwd). Background In hospital, the number of Plwd continues to rise; however, their experiences of care remain problematic. Negative experiences of care are likely to contribute to poorer mental and physical health outcomes for Plwd while in hospital and after discharge. Experiences of the hospital staff who care for Plwd can also be poor or unrewarding. It is important to understand the experiences of staff in order to improve staff well-being and ultimately the experience of care for Plwd while in hospital. Design Systematic review and evidence synthesis of qualitative research. Data sources We searched 16 electronic databases in March 2018 and completed forward and backward citation chasing. Methods Eligible studies explored the experiences of paid and unpaid staff providing care in hospital for Plwd. Study selection was undertaken independently by two reviewers, and quality appraisal was conducted. We prioritised included studies according to richness of text, methodological rigour and conceptual contribution. We adopted approaches of meta-ethnography to analyse study findings, creating a conceptual model to represent the line of argument. Findings Forty-five studies reported in 58 papers met the inclusion criteria, and of these, we prioritised 19 studies reported in 24 papers. The line of argument was that Institutions can improve staff experiences of care for Plwd by fostering person-centred care (PCC). PCC aligned with staff perceptions of 'good care'; however, staff often felt prevented from providing PCC because of care cultures that prioritised tasks, routines and physical health. Staff experienced conflict over the care they wanted to give versus the care they were able to give, and this caused moral distress. When staff were able to provide PCC, this increased experiences of job satisfaction and emotional well-being. Conclusions Person-centred care not only has the potential to improve the experience of care for Plwd and their carers, but can also improve the experiences of hospital staff caring for Plwd. However, without institutional-level changes, hospital staff are often unable to provide PCC even when they have the experience and knowledge to do so. Implications for practice Institutional-level areas for change include the following: training; performance indicators and ward cultures that prioritise psychological needs alongside physical needs; adequate staffing levels; inclusive approaches to carers; physical environments that promote familiarisation, social interaction and occupation; systems of documentation about individual needs of Plwd; and cultures of sharing knowledge across hierarchies.",0
https://doi.org/10.1017/neu.2019.35,Stimulation-induced side effects after deep brain stimulation – a systematic review,"Deep brain stimulation (DBS) was approved by Food and Drug Administration for Parkinson's disease, essential tremor, primary generalised or segmental dystonia and obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) treatment. The exact mechanism of DBS remains unclear which causes side effects. The aim of this review was to assess variables causing stimulation-induced chronic psychiatric/personality-changing side effects.The analysis of scientific database (PubMed, Cochrane Library, EMBASE) was conducted. The included articles had to be research study or case report and DBS to be conducted in therapeutic purposes. The researches with mental disorders in patients' medical histories were excluded.Seventeen articles were used in the review. In the group of movement disorders the characteristic of side effects was strongly related to the placement of the electrode implantation. Tiredness/fatigue was correlated with DBS in thalamus. Implantations in subthalamic nucleus were mostly followed by affective side effects such as depression or suicide. The higher voltage of electrode was connected with more severe depression after implantation. The analysis of affective disorder contained only three articles - two about OCD and one about depression. Forgetfulness and word-finding problems as activities connected with cognition may be an inevitable side effect if obsessive thoughts are to be inhibited.DBS of subthalamic nucleus should be seen as the most hazardous place of implantation. As a result there is a strong need of 'gold standards' based on the connectivity research and closer cooperation of scientists and clinicians.",0
https://doi.org/10.1016/j.pdpdt.2020.101774,Photodynamic therapy treatment of superficial fungal infections: A systematic review,"Abstract Background Fungal infections in skin, hair and nails affect up to 25 % of the global population. Conventional antifungal treatment is effective but due to resistance, treatment failure, drug interactions, and treatment related toxicity, there is a need for alternative treatments. Photodynamic therapy (PDT) has shown antimicrobial properties and is used increasingly for fungal infections. This review investigates the reported efficacy and side effects of PDT of superficial mycoses. Methods Pubmed and Embase were searched 26-01-2020 for “superficial fungal infections” and “photodynamic therapy” in “Human subjects” using a predefined search string. Criteria for inclusion were: clinical trials and cases involving PDT-treated patients with primary fungal infections in skin, hair and nails. Criteria for exclusion were: languages other than English, animal models, in vitro trials, secondary fungal infections, reviews and guidelines. Results 541 records were identified and 34 papers fulfilled the criteria. PDT of onychomycosis (n = 380 patients) found treatment with methylene blue (MB) photosensitizer (PS) more efficacious with complete cure rates of 70 %–80 % than 5-aminolevulinic acid (ALA)-PDT (mycological cure rates of 17 %–57 %) and methyl aminolevulinate (MAL)-PDT (mycological cure rate of 32 %). Other PDT-treated fungal diseases included (n = 55): foot infections (n = 19), tinea cruris (n = 10), scalp infections (n = 2), Malassezia infections (n = 9) and subcutaneous fungal infections (n = 15) achieved promising effect. Conclusion PDT-treatment of superficial mycoses can be efficacious as salvage therapy. In the light of increasing resistance and few licensed treatment alternatives, larger randomized controlled trials investigations and optimization of the PDT-treatment protocol are warranted to evaluate PDT’s potential as a future antifungal treatment.",0
https://doi.org/10.1097/md.0000000000019691,Association between red cell distribution width level and risk of stroke,"Red cell distribution width level may have relations with the incidence and prognosis of cerebrovascular diseases. Recent researches have reported that red cell distribution width level was linked to the occurrence of stroke. However, the predicted effect of red cell distribution width in stroke is still disputed. We sought to assess the relationship between red cell distribution width and risk of stroke in this meta-analysis.Relevant studies were picked out from the databases of Embase, PubMed, and Cochrane Library. Hazard ratio with 95% confidence interval was chosen to analyze each trial, which was extracted from results of the highest and lowest red cell distribution width group. Funnel plots, Begg and Egger test were used to assess publication bias in the meta-analysis. Stata(12.0) was utilized to perform statistic analysis in the process.A total of 6 studies with 5783 patients were included in this meta-analysis. The results showed that red cell distribution width level in patients with stroke was significantly higher than it in those without stroke (HR = 1.34, 95%CI:1.23-1.47, P < .001), in particular ischemic stroke(HR = 1.34,95% confidence interval:1.1-1.54, P < .001). There was no evidence of heterogeneity across the studies (P = .355, I = 5.53%).The higher red cell distribution width level was associated with an increased risk of stroke, especially ischemic infarction.",0

Recent advances in wearable sensor technology made this challenge affordable; however, its impact on breath-hold diving has never been comprehensively discussed. Methods We performed a systematic review of the literature in order to assess what types of sensors are available or suitable for human breath-hold diving, within the two-fold perspective of safety and athletic performance. Results In the 52 studies identified, sensed physiological variables were: electrocardiogram, body temperature, blood pressure, peripheral oxygen saturation, interstitial glucose concentration, impedance cardiography, heart rate, body segment inertia and orientation. Conclusions Limits and potential of each technology are separately reviewed. Inertial sensor technology and transmission pulse oximetry could produce the greatest impact on breath-hold diving performances in the future.",0

Original data in all epidemiological studies (any design except case-studies and case-series) that reported EHI incidence data in organised sports, across all age categories, and published in an English language peer-reviewed journal were included.The primary search yielded 3556 results of which 62 studies were included in the final analysis, with 71% being from the USA. Reported EHI incidence rates ranged from 0.01 (cheerleading) to 4.19 (American football) per 1000 athletic-exposures (AEs), and 0.01 (mini-marathon) to 54.54 (desert ultra-marathon) per 100 participants. Endurance type events (running, cycling, adventure races) reported the highest EHI incidence rates per 100 participants. There was a considerable increase in EHI fatalities reported in the literature over the last three decades in American football and an increased reporting of EHI incidence in endurance type events during the last 5-years.Use of different terminology and injury definitions in most studies have resulted in an inconsistency in reporting EHI incidence data, and also likely underreporting of less-severe forms of EHI conditions. Longitudinal studies focused on different sports and conducted in more countries (outside the USA), are needed for better understanding the global impact of EHI and the impact of prevention measures.",0

Nevertheless, the prognostic value of AR expression in patients with triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) remains controversial. Therefore, in this meta-analysis, we investigated AR expression and its impact on survival outcome. PubMed, Embase, the Cochrane Library, and references of articles were searched to identify relevant studies that investigated the association between AR expression and prognosis in patients diagnosed with TNBC and were published between 1946 and May 2019. The hazard ratio (HR) and confidence interval (CI) of disease-free survival, overall survival, distant disease-free survival, and recurrence-free survival were weighted and pooled by using the fixed-effect or random-effect model based on the heterogeneity of included studies. A total of 27 studies including 4914 patients with TNBC were included. AR was expressed in 27.96% (1315/4703) of patients with TNBC. In addition, AR expression in TNBC was not associated with disease-free survival (HR, 0.923; 95% CI, 0.671-1.271; P = .634), overall survival (HR, 0.910; 95% CI, 0.678-1.222; P = .531), distant disease-free survival (HR, 1.02; 95% CI, 0.96-1.08; P = .489), or recurrence-free survival (HR, 0.957; 95% CI, 0.462-1.982; P = .906) in TNBC, regardless of confounding factors and heterogeneity that existed among included studies.

Eligibility criteria for study selection Studies describing the development or external validation of an early warning score for adult hospital inpatients. Results 13 171 references were screened and 95 articles were included in the review. 11 studies were development only, 23 were development and external validation, and 61 were external validation only. Most early warning scores were developed for use in the United States (n=13/34, 38%) and the United Kingdom (n=10/34, 29%). Death was the most frequent prediction outcome for development studies (n=10/23, 44%) and validation studies (n=66/84, 79%), with different time horizons (the most frequent was 24 hours). The most common predictors were respiratory rate (n=30/34, 88%), heart rate (n=28/34, 83%), oxygen saturation, temperature, and systolic blood pressure (all n=24/34, 71%). Age (n=13/34, 38%) and sex (n=3/34, 9%) were less frequently included. Key details of the analysis populations were often not reported in development studies (n=12/29, 41%) or validation studies (n=33/84, 39%). Small sample sizes and insufficient numbers of event patients were common in model development and external validation studies. Missing data were often discarded, with just one study using multiple imputation. Only nine of the early warning scores that were developed were presented in sufficient detail to allow individualised risk prediction. Internal validation was carried out in 19 studies, but recommended approaches such as bootstrapping or cross validation were rarely used (n=4/19, 22%). Model performance was frequently assessed using discrimination (development n=18/22, 82%; validation n=69/84, 82%), while calibration was seldom assessed (validation n=13/84, 15%). All included studies were rated at high risk of bias. Conclusions Early warning scores are widely used prediction models that are often mandated in daily clinical practice to identify early clinical deterioration in hospital patients. However, many early warning scores in clinical use were found to have methodological weaknesses. Early warning scores might not perform as well as expected and therefore they could have a detrimental effect on patient care. Future work should focus on following recommended approaches for developing and evaluating early warning scores, and investigating the impact and safety of using these scores in clinical practice.

Here, we report result from a search for English-language articles on the resistance mechanisms and clonality of Gram-positive bacteria in Africa between 2007 and 2019 reported in PubMed, Web of Science, ScienceDirect, and African Journals OnLine; 172 studies from 22 different African countries were identified. Resistance genes, such as mecA, erm(B), erm(C), tet(M), tet(K), tet(L), vanB, vanA, vanC, and tet(O), were found to be common. Staphylococcus spp., Enterococcus spp., and Streptococcus spp. were the main species reported by the studies, with clones such as Staphylococcus aureus ST5 (n = 218 isolates), ST8 (n = 127 isolates), ST80 (n = 133 isolates), and ST88 (n = 117 isolates), and mobile genetic elements such as IS16 (n = 28 isolates), IS256 (n = 96), Tn916 (n = 107 isolates), and SCCmec (n = 4437 isolates) identified. SCCmec IV (n = 747 isolates) was predominant, followed by SCCmec III (n = 305 isolates), SCCmec II (n = 163 isolates), SCCmec V (n = 135 isolates), and SCCmec I (n = 79 isolates). Resistance to penicillin (n = 5926 isolates), tetracycline (n = 5300 isolates), erythromycin (n = 5151 isolates), rifampicin (n = 3823 isolates), gentamycin (n = 3494 isolates), sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim (n = 3089 isolates), and ciprofloxacin (n = 2746 isolates) was common in most reports from 22 countries. Clonal dissemination of resistance across countries and between humans, animals, and the environment was observed. Resistance rates ranged from 1.4% to 100% for 15 of the studies; 10 were One Health-related studies.

With growing interest in the potential of cannabinoids, there is a need to inform risk-benefit considerations. Thus, this focused systematic review assesses the quality of safety assessment and reporting in chronic noncancer pain cannabinoid trials. Methods The protocol for this review has been published, and, registered in PROSPERO. We searched MEDLINE, Embase, The Cochrane Library, Scopus, and PsychINFO for double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized controlled trials of cannabinoids for chronic pain, with a primary outcome related to pain. The primary review outcome is adherence to the 2004 Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials (CONSORT) Harms extension. Secondary outcomes included type, reporting method, frequency and severity of adverse events (AEs), trial participant withdrawals, and reasons for withdrawals. Results In total, 43 studies (4436 participants) were included. Type of cannabinoid (number of studies) included nabiximols (12), dronabinol (8), nabilone (7), oral cannabis extract preparations (5), smoked tetrahydrocannabinol (5), vaporized tetrahydrocannabinol (3), novel synthetic cannabinoids (2), sublingual cannabis extract preparations (1). The median CONSORT score was 7. On average, 3 to 4 recommendations of the CONSORT guidelines were not being met in trials. Seventeen trials did not provide their method of AE assessment, 14 trials did not report on serious AEs and, 7 trials provided no quantitative data about AEs. Discussion Better harms assessment and reporting are needed in chronic pain cannabinoid trials. Improvements may be achieved through: expanded education/knowledge translation increased research regulation by ethics boards, funding agencies and journals, and greater emphasis on safety assessment and reporting throughout research training.",0
https://doi.org/10.1089/lgbt.2019.0328,How Intersectional Are Mental Health Interventions for Sexual Minority People? A Systematic Review,"Purpose: Complex and widespread stigma exposes sexual minority people to disproportionate risks for adverse mental health. Intersectionality theory calls for consideration of the unique experiences of living with multiple forms of inequality. Yet, concerns remain regarding the extent to which intersectionality theory has been integrated into mental health interventions for sexual minority populations. This systematic review aims to assess the degree to which available mental health interventions account for intersecting forms of marginalization and to identify methods that facilitate the application of intersectionality. Methods: A search for peer-reviewed English language journal articles was conducted using PsycINFO and PubMed to locate reports of mental health interventions for sexual minority groups. A coding framework was designed to evaluate how interventions incorporated intersectionality theory. Results: Of 1877 potentially eligible articles, forty-three were included in the analysis. They were each classified as low, medium, or high with regard to intersectionality. Thirteen (30.2%) were rated as low on intersectionality for only recruiting a homogeneous group of participants in the interventions; 23 (53.4%) were classified as medium for including additional identities in recruitment without responding to possible intersectional disadvantages; 7 (16.3%) were rated as high with adequate consideration of the complex effects of intersecting positions. In addition, the review identified community-based participatory research as a common and instrumental method to ensure intersectionality. Conclusions: This review highlights the limitations of interventions for sexual minority people in addressing intersectionality. Guidelines are needed for clinical practice and evaluation to adequately incorporate intersectionality theory.",0

Several treatment modalities have been investigated in an attempt to improve the management of MBM. This review aimed to evaluate the impact of current treatments for MBM on patient- and tumor-related outcomes, and to provide treatment recommendations for this patient population. A literature search in the databases PubMed, Embase, Web of Science and Cochrane was conducted up to January 8, 2019. Original articles published since 2010 describing patient- and tumor-related outcomes of adult MBM patients treated with clearly defined systemic therapy were included. Information on basic trial demographics, treatment under investigation and outcomes (overall and progression-free survival, local and distant control and toxicity) were extracted. We identified 96 eligible articles, comprising 95 studies. A large variety of treatment options for MBM were investigated, either used alone or as combined modality therapy. Combined modality therapy was investigated in 71% of the studies and resulted in increased survival and better distant/local control than monotherapy, especially with targeted therapy or immunotherapy. However, neurotoxic side-effects also occurred more frequently. Timing appeared to be an important determinant, with the best results when radiotherapy was given before or during systemic therapy. Improved tumor control and prolonged survival can be achieved by combining radiotherapy with immunotherapy or targeted therapy. However, more randomized controlled trials or prospective studies are warranted to generate proper evidence that can be used to change the standard of care for patients with MBM.",0

Study inclusion criteria were: ≥20 female football players in each study arm (any age, football code or participation level) and injury incidence reporting.Twelve studies, all in soccer, met inclusion criteria, with nine involving adolescent teams (aged <18 years). All studies (except one) had a high risk of bias. Eleven studies examined exercise-based programmes, with most (9/11) including multiple (≥2) training components (eg, strength, plyometric, balance exercises). Multicomponent exercise programmes reduced overall (any reported) injuries (incidence rate ratio (IRR) 0.73, 95% CI 0.59 to 0.91) and ACL injuries (IRR 0.55, 95% CI 0.32 to 0.92). For exercise-based strategies (single-component and multicomponent), hamstring injuries were also reduced (IRR 0.40, 95% CI 0.17 to 0.95). While exercise-based strategies resulted in less knee, ankle and hip/groin injuries, and the use of multiple training components was associated with greater reductions in overall and knee injuries, further studies would be required to increase the precision of these results. The incidence of overall injuries in women's football was 3.4 per 1000 exposure hours; with ankle injuries most common.In women's football, there is low-level evidence that multicomponent, exercise-based programmes reduce overall and ACL injuries by 27% and 45%, respectively.CRD42018093527.",0
https://doi.org/10.1186/s13643-020-01366-x,"Determining optimal strategies for primary prevention of cardiovascular disease: systematic review, cost-effectiveness review and network meta-analysis protocol","Abstract Background Despite recent improvements in the burden of cardiovascular disease (CVD) in the UK, deaths from CVD are relatively high compared with other high-income countries. An estimated 7 million people in the UK are living with CVD, and the healthcare cost is approximately £11 billion annually. In more than 90% of cases, the risk of a first heart attack is thought to be related to modifiable risk factors including smoking, poor diet, lipidemia, high blood pressure, inactivity, obesity and excess alcohol consumption. The aim of the study is to synthesise evidence for the comparative effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of different interventions for the primary prevention of CVD. Methods We will systematically search databases (for example, MEDLINE (Ovid), Embase (Ovid), Cochrane Library) and the reference lists of previous systematic reviews for randomised controlled trials that assess the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of any form of intervention aimed at adult populations for the primary prevention of CVD, including but not limited to lipid lowering medications, blood pressure lowering medications, antiplatelet agents, nutritional supplements, dietary interventions, health promotion programmes, physical activity interventions or structural and policy interventions. Interventions may or may not be targeted at high-risk groups. Publications from any year will be considered for inclusion. The primary outcome will be all cause mortality. Secondary outcomes will be cardiovascular diseases related mortality, major cardiovascular events, coronary heart disease, incremental costs per quality-adjusted life years gained. If data permits, we will use network meta-analysis to compare and rank effectiveness of different interventions, and test effect modification of intervention effectiveness using subgroup analyses and meta-regression analyses. Discussion The results will be important for policymakers when making decisions between multiple possible alternative strategies to prevent CVD. Compared to results from existing multiple separate pairwise meta-analyses, this overarching synthesis of all relevant work will enhance decision-making. The findings will be crucial to inform evidence-based priorities and guidelines for policies and planning prevention strategies of CVD. Systematic review registration PROSPERO CRD42019123940 .",0
https://doi.org/10.1016/j.chemosphere.2020.126668,Maternal air pollution exposure and congenital heart defects in offspring: A systematic review and meta-analysis,"Congenital heart defects (CHDs) has a multifactorial causation with a strong genetic component and many environmental triggers. Emerging body of empirical studies suggest that air pollution is an important contributor to the development of CHDs, however, there still remains some controversy over the current evidence, and to the authors’ knowledge, no studies have reviewed the most recent evidence. We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of epidemiological literature to investigate the relationship between maternal air pollution exposure and CHDs risk in offspring. The presence of heterogeneity and publication bias across available studies were also examined. An extensive literature search of epidemiological studies pertaining to air pollution and CHDs, published in English language, until August 1, 2019 was conducted. Summary risk estimates of pollution–outcome combinations were calculated for i) risk per specific increment of concentration and ii) risk at high versus low exposure level in each study using fixed-effect model or random-effects model. A total of 26 studies were finally included. In the meta-analyses, high versus low carbon monoxide (CO) exposure was associated with an increased risk of tetralogy of Fallot [odds ratio (OR) = 1.21, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.04–1.41], yet particulate matter ≤ 5 μm (PM 2.5 ) exposure was marginally associated with it. Increased risk of atrial septal defects (ASDs) was found for each 10 μg/m 3 and 10 ppb increment in particulate matter ≤ 10 μm (PM 10 ) and ozone (O 3 ) exposure, respectively (OR = 1.04, 95% CI: 1.00–1.09; OR = 1.09, 95% CI: 1.02–1.17). Categorical nitrogen dioxide (NO 2 ) exposure was associated with an increased risk of coarctation of the aorta (OR for high versus low = 1.14, 95% CI: 1.02–1.26). Analyses for other combinations yielded none statistically significant associations. Sensitive analyses showed similar findings. The summary effect estimates from this study suggest statistically significant associations between increased risk of specific CHDs subtypes and PM 2.5 , PM 10 , NO 2 , CO, and O 3 exposures. Further studies, especially conducted in developing countries, with improvements in exposure assessing, outcome harmonizing, and mechanistic understanding are needed to elaborate the suggestive associations. • Whether maternal exposure to air pollution contributes to the development of CHDs in offspring is a controversial question. • We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of epidemiological studies investigating this question. • Twenty-six studies met our eligibility criteria and were included in our systematic review and meta-analysis. • Overall, there was notable variability in CHDs definitions, air pollution exposure assessment and confounder adjustment. • The study suggests significant associations between maternal air pollution exposure and increased risk of specific CHDs subtypes in offspring.

Nevertheless, risk factors for neurocognitive decline after PCI remain unclear.We systematically reviewed the PubMed database according to the PRISMA guideline. Inclusion criteria were: randomized clinical trials (RCTs) and observational/single arm trials evaluating PCI, including ≥20 patients, reporting neurocognitive test results for lung cancer. Primary aim: evaluate risk factors associated with neurocognitive decline after PCI.Twenty records were eligible (8 different RCTs, 8 observational studies), including 3553 patients in total (858 NSCLC, 2695 SCLC) of which 73.6% received PCI. Incidence of mild/moderate cognitive decline after PCI varied from 8 to 89% (grading not always provided); for those without PCI, this was 3.4-42%. Interestingly, 23-95% had baseline cognitive impairment. Risk factors were often not reported. In one trial, both age (>60 years) and higher PCI dose (36 Gy) including twice-daily PCI were associated with a higher risk of cognitive decline. In one trial, white matter abnormalities were more frequent in the concurrent or sandwiched PCI arm, but without significant neuropsychological differences. One trial identified hippocampal sparing PCI to limit the neurocognitive toxicities of PCI and another reported an association between hippocampal dose volume effects and memory decline. As neurocognition was a secondary endpoint in most RCTs, and was assessed by various instruments with often poor/moderate compliance, high-quality data is lacking.Age, PCI dose, regimen and timing might be associated with cognitive impairment after PCI in lung cancer patients, but high-quality data is lacking. Future PCI trials should collect and evaluate possible risk factors systematically.",0

Optimal management and clinical outcomes of pregnant women with cryptococcosis are limited to case reports, as pregnant women are often excluded from research. Amongst pregnant women with asymptomatic cryptococcosis, no treatment guidelines exist. We prospectively identified HIV-infected women who were pregnant or recently pregnant with cryptococcosis, screened during a series of meningitis research studies in Uganda from 2012 to 2018. Among 571 women screened for cryptococcosis, 13 were pregnant, one was breastfeeding, three were within 14 days postpartum, and two had recently miscarried. Of these 19 women (3.3%), 12 had cryptococcal meningitis, six had cryptococcal antigenemia, and one had a history of cryptococcal meningitis and was receiving secondary prophylaxis. All women with meningitis received amphotericin B deoxycholate (0.7–1.0 mg/kg). Five were exposed to 200–800 mg fluconazole during pregnancy. Of these five, three delivered healthy babies with no gross physical abnormalities at birth, one succumbed to meningitis, and one outcome was unknown. Maternal meningitis survival rate at hospital discharge was 75% (9/12), and neonatal/fetal survival rate was 44% (4/9) for those mothers who survived. Miscarriages and stillbirths were common (n = 4). Of six women with cryptococcal antigenemia, two received fluconazole, one received weekly amphotericin B, and three had unknown treatment courses. All women with antigenemia survived, and none developed clinical meningitis. We report good maternal outcomes but poor fetal outcomes for cryptococcal meningitis using amphotericin B, without fluconazole in the first trimester, and weekly amphotericin B in place of fluconazole for cryptococcal antigenemia.",0

There is no consensus on the potential long-term neurodevelopmental outcomes of early SSRI exposure. Our aim was to determine whether there is an overall effect of perinatal SSRI exposure in animals on a spectrum of behavioral domains. After a comprehensive database search in PubMed, PsycINFO, and Web of Science, we included 99 publications. We performed nine meta-analyses and two qualitative syntheses corresponding to different behavioral categories, aggregating data from thousands of animals. We found evidence for reduced activity and exploration behavior (standardized mean difference (SMD) -0.28 [-0.38, -0.18]), more passive stress coping (SMD -0.37 [-0.52, -0.23]), and less efficient sensory processing (SMD -0.37 [-0.69, -0.06]) in SSRI- versus vehicle-exposed animals. No differences were found for anxiety (p = 0.06), social behavior, learning and memory, ingestive- and reward behavior, motoric behavior, or reflex and pain sensitivity.

No review to date has addressed the clinical presentations and traumatic backgrounds associated with these disorders although this work is essential for the development of effective interventions. Objectives To systematically explore similarities and differences in traumatic history and clinical presentation in comorbid BPD and PTSD as compared to PTSD or BPD alone. Method The Web of Science, Cochrane Library, PsycINFO, MEDLINE, and PILOTS databases were searched systematically. Eligible studies included adult populations, compared comorbid BPD/PTSD to a single disorder, and published in English. Results A total of 10,147 cases across 33 studies were included: 2,057 comorbid BPD/PTSD, 2,648 BPD only, and 5,442 PTSD only. The comorbid group overall reported greater exposure to multiple and interpersonal trauma and elevated emotion dysregulation compared to both single-disorder groups. In terms of methodological quality, most papers achieved a Fair rating with improvements required in minimizing bias through recruiting adequate and representative samples, and reporting on traumatic exposure. Conclusion Multiple and interpersonal trauma might have a unique role in the development of comorbid BPD/PTSD features, particularly so for emotion dysregulation. Future research is required to unravel the unique characteristics of interpersonal trauma that can generate BPD and PTSD symptoms. Practitioner points Practitioners should routinely assess for interpersonal trauma considering its impact. Tackling emotion regulation difficulties might promote recovery from both PTSD and BPD symptoms. Presence of self -injury might be used to discriminate between PTSD and BPD and offer suitable interventions.",0

These studies, however, showed inconsistent results. To inspect the association between aspirin use and depression, we conducted a meta-analysis of observational studies. Methods In August 2019, two authors independently searched PubMed, EMBASE, and PsycINFO to retrieve observational epidemiological studies presenting an association between aspirin use and depression. Case-control and cohort studies were included, and odds ratios (ORs) or relative risks (RRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for the risk of depression were estimated using a random-effects model. In addition, number needed to harm (NNH) was calculated to measure the rates of depression. Results In total, 12 observational studies-five case-control studies and seven prospective cohort studies-were included in this meta-analysis. The random-effects model demonstrated a significant association between aspirin use and depression (OR/RR 1.10; 95% CI: 1.05-1.16) with insignificant heterogeneity (I2 = 23.3%). The risk estimates of depression from prospective cohort studies were similar (RR 1.11; 95% CI: 1.08-1.14), and heterogeneity was not observed (I2 = 0.0%). In the subgroup meta-analysis, a duration of aspirin use ≥5 years and a dosage ≥500 mg daily were also associated with depression. The NNH for depression with aspirin use >5 years was 103 (95% CI 91-111) indicating that observed event is rare. Conclusions Aspirin use was associated with depression in the present meta-analysis. One of the major limitations is the lack of detail and consistency with respect to exposure verification in the included papers. Another limitation is the lack of randomized controlled studies and prospective cohort studies.",0

The relevance of this stress reactivity to long-term health and disease outcomes is of great importance. We examined prospective studies in apparently healthy adults to test the hypothesis that the magnitude of the response to acute psychological stress in healthy adults is related to future health and disease outcomes. Methods We searched Medline Complete, PsycINFO, CINAHL Complete and Embase up to 15 Aug 2019. Included studies were peer-reviewed, English-language, prospective studies in apparently healthy adults. The exposure was acute psychological stress reactivity (SAM system or HPA axis) at baseline. The outcome was any health or disease outcome at follow-up after ≥1 year. Results We identified 1719 papers through database searching and 1 additional paper through other sources. Forty-seven papers met our criteria including 32,866 participants (range 30–4100) with 1−23 years of follow-up. Overall, one third (32 %; 83/263) of all reported findings were significant and two thirds (68 %; 180/263) were null. With regard to the significant findings, both exaggerated (i.e. high) and blunted (i.e. low) stress reactivity of both the SAM system and the HPA axis at baseline were related to health and disease outcomes at follow-up. Exaggerated stress reactivity at baseline predicted an increase in risk factors for cardiovascular disease and decreased telomere length at follow-up. In contrast, blunted stress reactivity predicted future increased adiposity and obesity, more depression, anxiety and PTSD symptoms, greater illness frequency, musculoskeletal pain and regulatory T-Cell percentage, poorer cognitive ability, poorer self-reported health and physical disability and lower bone mass. Conclusion Exaggerated and blunted SAM system and HPA axis stress reactivity predicted distinct physical and mental health and disease outcomes over time. Results from prospective studies consistently indicate stress reactivity as a predictor for future health and disease outcomes. Dysregulation of stress reactivity may represent a mechanism by which psychological stress contributes to the development of future health and disease outcomes.",0

One commonly recognized response to trauma exposure is posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). The biological underpinnings of PTSD, including epigenetic mechanisms of DNA methylation and gene expression, have been studied intensively. However, psychological posttrauma responses vary widely and can include positive outcomes, such as posttraumatic growth (PTG) and, more commonly, resilience. The aim of this systematic review was to summarize the current DNA methylation and gene expression data with respect to three potential posttrauma responses: PTSD, PTG, and resilience. A literature search identified 486 studies, 51 of which were deemed eligible for inclusion (total N = 10,633). All included studies examined PTSD and consistently implicated DNA methylation and gene expression changes in hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis and inflammatory genes. Ten studies acknowledged resilience as a posttrauma response, but only two studies examined epigenetics and gene expression using a scale to measure resilience. Low resilience was associated with gene expression patterns in immune and dopamine genes, and high resilience was associated with a blunted inflammatory response. No studies examined epigenetic or gene expression changes associated with PTG. These findings highlight a focus on pathogenic research, which has failed to adequately acknowledge and measure positive posttrauma outcomes of PTG and resilience. Future research should examine DNA methylation and gene expression changes associated with PTG and resilience in addition to PTSD in order to gain a more comprehensive picture of an individual's well-being following exposure to trauma.",0

Our purpose was to collect and synthesize available recommendations concerning vitamin D in adolescents (aged 10–19 years). Methods We searched PubMed, EMBASE, and Cochrane databases from inception to February 5, 2019, for guidance published by different professional associations and governments. We also searched the reference lists of identified recommendations and explored the gray literature using Web search engines. We organized documents by theme: dietary requirements, thresholds, prophylactic supplementation, and treatment of deficiency. Results A total of 32 documents were identified. Most of them targeted the general population and not specifically the age group of adolescents. There is a general agreement that adolescents should not have serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentrations below 25–30 nmol/L to avoid poor bone health. However, there is lack of consensus on the optimal concentration to aim for, levels varying between 25 nmol/L and 150 nmol/L. Adequate nutritional requirements of vitamin D are also subject to debate with values ranging between 200 IU/d and 1,000 IU/d. The upper tolerable intake is estimated at 4,000 IU/d by all study groups. Certain associations recommend routine vitamin D supplementation in adolescents. The recommended daily preventive doses vary between 400 IU and 4,000 IU, depending on season, skin pigmentation, sun exposure, consumption of vitamin D–fortified foods, body mass index, and coexistence of certain medical conditions. In case of deficiency, different therapeutic regimens of oral vitamin D are proposed depending on the presence of illness and/or the baseline serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentrations. Duration of the treatment varies between 4 weeks and 3 months. A maintenance dose is generally recommended after treatment. Conclusions At present, there is no consensus among the different societies about vitamin D needs during adolescence. Stronger, evidence-based guidance is needed to inform clinical practice.",0

Medline, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Library were searched on August 22, 2019. The population included both adult and pediatric patients with cardiac arrest. Two investigators reviewed abstracts, extracted data, and assessed the risk of bias. Meta-analyses were performed for studies without excessive bias. Certainty of evidence was evaluated using GRADE. <h3>Results</h3> We included 7 trials and 36 observational studies comparing oxygenation or ventilation targets. Most of the trials and observational studies included adults with out-of-hospital cardiac arrest. There were 6 observational studies in children. Bias for trials ranged from low to high risk, with group imbalances and blinding being primary concerns. Bias for observational studies was rated as serious or critical risk with confounding and exposure classification being primary sources of bias. Meta-analyses including two trials comparing low vs high oxygen therapy and two trials comparing hypercapnia vs no hypercapnia were inconclusive. Point estimates of individual studies generally favored normoxemia and normocapnia over hyper- or hypoxemia and hyper- or hypocapnia. <h3>Conclusions</h3> We identified a large number of studies related to oxygenation and ventilation targets in cardiac arrest. The majority of studies did not reach statistical significance and were limited by excessive risk of bias. Point estimates of individual studies generally favored normoxemia and normocapnia.",0

As attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is one of the most common neuropsychiatric disorders in children and adolescents and often persists into adulthood, the purpose of this systematic review and meta-analysis was to investigate the relationship between T. gondii infection and ADHD.The data were systematically collected from seven electronic databases up to May 1st 2019 with no language restriction. This study was registered at the International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews (PROSPERO; code: CRD42020149353). Odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were estimated using a random effects model. Seven studies involving five cross-sectional and two case-control studies were included in this meta-analysis.Results indicated that there was a statistically non-significant association between exposure to T. gondii infection and increased risk of ADHD based on the detection of immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibody (2.02 [95% CI: 0.97-4.20]; I2=58.7%). However, obtained results of Egger's tests for anti-T. gondii IgG antibody showed publication bias (P=0.014).Sensitivity analysis revealed stable results for the association between anti-T. gondii IgG antibody with ADHD.Given the small number of studies in this field and the obtained results, it cannot be conclusively stated that T. gondii is a risk factor for ADHD.It is important to have reliable information about the relationship between T. gondii and ADHD around the world; as it may lead to better insight to elucidate the possible association of toxoplasmosis and the pathogenesis of ADHD.",0

The odds of overall complication were significantly higher in the autogenous bone group (n = 214/644 procedures, 33.2%) than the bone substitute groups (n = 116/436 procedures, 26.7%, CI 1.29-2.35, p < 0.05). In bone substitutes groups, there was no significant difference in overall complication rate between HA and Ti (OR, 1.2; 95% CI, 0.47-3.14, p = 0.69). PEEK has lower overall complication rates (OR, 0.51; 95% CI, 0.30-0.87, p = 0.01) and lower implant exposure rates (OR, 0.17; 95% CI, 0.06-0.53, p = 0.002) than Ti, but there was no significant difference in infection rates and postoperative hematoma rates.Conclusions: Cranioplasty is associated with high overall complication rates with the use of autologous bone grafts compared with bone substitutes. PEEK has a relatively low overall complication rates in substitutes groups, but still high infection rates and postoperative hematoma rates. Thus, autologous bone grafts should only be used selectively, and prospective long-term studies are needed to further refine a better material in cranioplasty.",0
https://doi.org/10.1111/ijd.14824,The banned sunscreen ingredients and their impact on human health: a systematic review,"Recent evidence of high systemic absorption of sunscreen ingredients has raised concerns regarding the safety of sunscreen products. Oxybenzone (BP-3) and octinoxate (OMC), two common sunscreen ingredients, were recently banned in Key West and Hawaii owing to their toxic effects on marine ecosystems. Their impact on human health requires a careful assessment. To summarize the current evidence on the association between the systemic level of BP-3 or OMC and its health impact, a primary literature search was conducted using PubMed database in February 2019. There are 29 studies that address the impact of these ingredients on human health. Studies show that elevated systemic level of BP-3 has no adverse effect on male and female fertility, female reproductive hormone level, adiposity, fetal growth, child's neurodevelopment, and sexual maturation. However, the association of BP-3 level on thyroid hormone, testosterone level, kidney function, and pubertal timing has been reported and prompts further investigations to validate a true association. The systemic absorption of OMC has no reported effect on thyroid and reproductive hormone levels. In conclusion, current evidence is not sufficient to support the causal relationship between the elevated systemic level of BP-3 or OMC and adverse health outcomes. There are either contradictory findings among different studies or an insufficient number of studies to corroborate the observed association. To accurately evaluate the long-term risk of exposure to BP-3 and OMC from sunscreen, a well-designed longitudinal randomized controlled trial needs to be conducted.",1

To address this deficit, this paper summarises the available evidence on the seroprevalence of Legionella antibodies and explores factors that may influence seroprevalence estimates. Through a systematic review, a total of 3979 studies were identified with seroprevalence results published after 1 January 1990. We tabulated findings by World Health Organization (WHO) region, location, study period and design, composition of study population(s) for all ages in terms of exposure, sex, detection methods, IFA titre, Legionella species measured, and present seroprevalence point estimates and 95% confidence intervals. Sampled populations were classified according to income, WHO region, gender, age, occupation and publication date. We conducted a meta-analysis on these subgroups using Comprehensive Meta-Analysis 3.0 software. Heterogeneity across studies was evaluated by the Q test in conjunction with I 2 statistics. Publication bias was evaluated via funnel plot and Egger’s test. Fifty-seven studies met our inclusion criteria, giving an overall estimate of seroprevalence for Legionella of 13.7% (95% CI 11.3–16.5), but with substantial heterogeneity across studies.",0

Design Systematic review. Interventions This systematic review was conducted following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines. PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, the Cochrane Library, and ClinicalTrials.gov were searched for studies concerning “head neck cancer,” “adjunctive analgesics,” “pain,” and “radiotherapy.” Outcome Measures Pain outcome, adverse events, and toxicity and other reported outcomes, for example, mucositis, quality of life, depression, etc. Results Nine studies were included in our synthesis. Most studies were of low quality and had a high risk of bias on several domains of the Cochrane Collaboration tool. Only two studies comprised high-quality randomized controlled trials in which pregabalin and a doxepin rinse showed their effectiveness for the treatment of neuropathic pain and pain from oral mucositis, respectively, in HNC patients receiving (chemo-) radiotherapy. Conclusions More high-quality trials are necessary to provide clear evidence on the effectiveness of adjunctive analgesics in the treatment of HNC (chemo-) radiation-induced pain.",0
https://doi.org/10.1111/jdv.16074,Adjuvant therapy for cutaneous melanoma: a systematic review and network meta‐analysis of new therapies,"New drugs have been recently approved as adjuvant therapies for melanoma. In this Bayesian network meta-analysis, we aimed to assess the best therapeutic option in terms of recurrence-free survival (RFS), overall survival (OS) and adverse events (AEs). PubMed, Embase, Cochrane library and the American Society of Clinical Oncology databases were searched from inception until 20 August 2018. We estimated adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) for RFS and OS and relative odds ratios (ORs) for AEs and surface under the cumulative ranking (SUCRA) probabilities were calculated. A number of 872 records were identified, and six were finally included in the meta-analysis. A total of 4244 patients in six studies were randomized. The following therapies were considered in the selected studies: combined dabrafenib and trametinib, vemurafenib, nivolumab, ipilimumab and pembrolizumab. Nivolumab demonstrated the highest probability (75.1%) of being the best in term of RFS, followed by dabrafenib+trametinib, pembrolizumab, ipilimumab and vemurafenib; however, OS was not estimable. Concerning AEs, pembrolizumab and nivolumab showed the highest probability to be less associated with any and 3–4 grade AEs (83.1% and 64.4%, respectively). In conclusion, all new drugs are highly effective in adjuvant setting, and the best choice is dependent of patient's context.",0

Despite the large amount of studies published in recent years, the relationship between mancozeb exposure and female reproductive health is not fully elucidated. In order to summarize current evidence on mancozeb exposure and female reproductive disease, we performed a systematic review of literature. Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines were used to make this review. An adapted version of the National Toxicology Program’s Office of Health and Assessment and Translation (OHAT) framework was used to evaluate the risk of bias. Electronic search on two databases (PubMed and Scopus) was used to find experimental studies (in vitro and in vivo) on mancozeb exposure. The database search identified 250 scientific articles, 20 of which met our inclusion criteria. Selected data were then reviewed and summarized in tables. Overall, mancozeb represents a hazard for female reproductive health, with different mechanisms of action. Undoubtedly more experimental and epidemiological studies are required to definitively validate mancozeb as reproductive toxicant.",1

Little is known about online peer-to-peer support for persons affected by prostate cancer (PC) and its potential effects. Our systematic review of the literature followed the PRISMA statement and revealed a total of 2372 records. Finally, 24 studies about online peer-to-peer support for persons affected by PC were selected for qualitative synthesis. Due to a lack of suitable quantitative results, the intended meta-analysis was not possible. Available studies were almost exclusively descriptive. Only one randomized controlled trial (RCT) included 40 PC survivors. In this study, quality of life improved in online support group (OSG) users and decreased in the control group. However, it returned to baseline in both groups after eight weeks. As a summary across all studies, OSGs play a significant role in patients’ treatment decision-making and for the social environment of PC patients. Information exchange in OSGs was predominant, but emotional and supportive content also had an important function. Due to the inconsistent methodology and the lack of reporting standards, a synthesis from the available studies is very limited. Population-based studies should focus on the actual use of OSGs. The effectiveness of OSGs needs to be investigated in RCTs.",0

Traditionally, this involves the use of a four-hole side plate. Reducing the length of the side plate would theoretically reduce the amount of surgical exposure required, decrease surgery duration, and decrease perioperative morbidity and mortality. Our study aims to review the current evidence regarding the use of two-hole side plates, their use and potential complications. Using PRISMA guidelines, two independent reviewers performed a search to collate the available literature from medical databases PubMed, EMBASE, Web of Science, and the Cochrane library. Only clinical and biochemical studies were included. The reference lists of articles included for full text review were searched for any additional primary or review publications. Four online libraries were searched, with a combined total of 5344 titles reviewed. Following title, abstract, and full text review, 8 articles were considered suitable for inclusion in qualitative analysis. There was a trend towards equal efficiency between two- and four-hole plates when used in stable fractures in terms of blood loss, failure/revision rates, operative and hospital stay durations, collapse loading testing, maximum stress, and fragment migration. The results of this study show that DHS constructs with two- or four-hole side plates have comparable outcomes when used in patients with stable fracture patterns. However, the majority of the clinical data regarding the use of two-hole DHS plates come from retrospective case series; further prospective, randomised control trials would be of significant benefit.

Estimates for smoking prevalence among adolescents in different regions and in the whole of China are important for the development of public health policies. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to estimate the prevalence of smoking among youth in China. This is a meta-analysis study. English (PubMed, EMBASE) and Chinese (China National Knowledge Internet, WANFANG Data, and CBM) databases were independently searched by two investigators from inception to May 2019. Random effects meta-analysis was conducted to estimate the pooled prevalence of smoking. Subgroup analysis and meta-regression were performed to investigate sources of heterogeneity. This study is registered with PROSPERO, number CRD42019130803. In total, 131 articles were included in the meta-analysis, with a total of 146 studies, involving 684,370 Chinese participants. The total prevalence of smoking among youth in mainland China was 8.17% (95% confidence interval: 6.97–9.45). Subgroup analysis showed that the geographic location and gender could significantly influence the prevalence of smoking. Meta-regression analyses revealed study year, sex ratio (male, %), and response rates did not contribute to the heterogeneity of the results (P-value >0.05). Sensitivity analysis showed that the results were statistically stable. This meta-analysis indicates that smoking is common among adolescents in China, and the rate varies between different regions. More practical and effective policies targeting adolescents are urgently needed.",0

Methods PubMed, EMBASE and MEDLINE were searched for randomised controlled trials in June and October 2019. Study selection, data extraction and risk of bias assessment were made by two independent reviewers using the Cochrane Handbook. Studies on prostaglandin analogue or beta-blocker eye-drops and patients with glaucoma or ocular hypertension were included. Primary outcome was change in intraocular pressure (IOP). Secondary outcomes were safety measures as assessed in original study. Results Of 433 articles screened, 16 studies were included. IOP meta-analysis was conducted on 13 studies (4201 patients) ranging from 15 days to 6 months. No significant differences between BAK versus PF and AP were identified (95% CI −0.00 to 0.30 mm Hg, p=0.05). Meta-analyses revealed no differences between BAK versus AP and PF with regards to conjunctival hyperaemia (risk ratio (RR) 1.05, 95% CI 0.91 to 1.22, 3800 patients, 9 studies), ocular hyperaemia (RR 1.31, 95% CI 0.96 to 1.78, 2268 patients, 5 studies), total ocular adverse events (RR 1.03, 95% CI 0.88 to 1.20, 1906 patients, 5 studies) or tear break-up time (mean difference 0.89, 95% CI −0.03 to 1.81, 130 patients, 3 studies). Diverse reporting on safety measures made comparison challenging. Risk of bias was assessed as high or unclear in many relevant domains, suggesting potential selective reporting or under-reporting. Conclusion No clinically significant differences on efficacy or safety could be determined between BAK versus AP and PF. However, there were substantial uncertainties on safety.

Because no clinical trial has been conducted to examine the surgical treatment of MBC, we performed a systematic review comparing the survival of patients with MBC who had undergone breast conserving surgery (BCS) and those who had undergone mastectomy and evaluated the patients' radiotherapy compliance after BCS. We performed a systematic search of electronic databases to find MBC cohort studies that had reported ≥ 1 survival outcome (disease-free survival [DFS], disease-specific survival [DSS], or overall survival [OS]) stratified by surgical treatment (BCS and/or mastectomy) and/or radiotherapy compliance with BCS. A total of 1 prospective and 9 retrospective cohort studies were included, with the number of patients ranging from 7 to 6039. Of the BCS patients, compliance with postoperative radiotherapy was low (range, 27%-46%), with the exception of 1 single-institution prospective study that reported 86% compliance (6 of 7 patients). The pooled estimate for all patients with MBC was 83% (95% confidence interval [CI], 78%-88%) for 5-year DSS and 66% (95% CI, 63%-70%) for 5-year OS. Most studies reported no differences in DFS, DSS, or OS for BCS and mastectomy. BCS is a reasonable treatment approach for MBC because it was associated with oncologic outcomes similar to those with mastectomy. However, the low rates of radiotherapy compliance among male patients who underwent BCS is concerning and highlights the importance of shared decision-making with patients with MBC when selecting a surgical treatment strategy.",0

Pooled meta-estimates were calculated using random-effects analyses. Subgroup analyses were conducted by study area, study design, and Newcastle-Ottawa quality score (NOS). Funnel plots and Egger's test were conducted to evaluate the publication bias, and Fail-safe Numbers (Fail-safe N) were measured to evaluate the robustness of models. From the initial 740 studies (last search, July 11, 2019), 26 studies were included in our analysis. The pooled odds ratio for the change in small for gestational age associated with per 500 m decrease in the distance to roads was 1.016 (95% CI: 1.004, 1.029). Subgroup analyses revealed significant positive associations between term low birth weight and traffic density in higher-quality literatures with higher NOS [1.060 (95% CI: 1.002, 1.121)], cohort studies [1.020 (95% CI: 1.006, 1.033)], and studies in North America [1.018 (95% CI: 1.005, 1.131)].

https://doi.org/10.1017/s1049023x20000291,The Principles of Triage in Emergencies and Disasters: A Systematic Review,"Abstract Introduction: The use of triage systems is one of the most important measures in response to mass-casualty incidents (MCIs) caused by emergencies and disasters. In these systems, certain principles and criteria must be considered that can be achieved with a lack of resources. Accordingly, the present study was conducted as a systematic review to explore the principles of triage systems in emergencies and disasters world-wide. Methods: The present study was conducted as a systematic review of the principles of triage in emergencies and disasters. All papers published from 2000 through 2019 were extracted from the Web of Science, PubMed, Scopus, Cochrane Library, and Google Scholar databases. The search for the articles was conducted by two trained researchers independently. Results: The classification and prioritization of the injured people, the speed, and the accuracy of the performance were considered as the main principles of triage. In certain circumstances, including chemical, biological, radiation, and nuclear (CBRN) incidents, certain principles must be considered in addition to the principles of the triage based on traumatic events. Usually in triage systems, the classification of the injured people is done using color labeling. The short duration of the triage and its accuracy are important for the survival of the injured individuals. The optimal use of available resources to protect the lives of more casualties is one of the important principles of triage systems and does not conflict with equity in health. Conclusion: The design of the principles of triage in triage systems is based on scientific studies and theories in which attempts have been made to correctly classify the injured people with the maximum correctness and in the least amount of time to maintain the survival of the injured people and to achieve the most desirable level of health. It is suggested that all countries adopt a suitable and context-bond model of triage in accordance with all these principles, or to propose a new model for the triage of injured patients, particularly for hospitals in emergencies and disasters.",0
https://doi.org/10.1002/brb3.1585,The scent of emotions: A systematic review of human intra‐ and interspecific chemical communication of emotions,"Objective The sense of olfaction has been considered of minor importance in human communication. In recent years, evidence has emerged that humans might be influenced by unconscious messages sent through chemosignals in body odors. Data concerning the ability of humans to recognize fear, maybe related to the evolutionary role of these emotions in the fight-or-flight reactions, are well known. Methods To further understand the role of emotional chemosignals in mediating communication in humans and its influence on animal behaviors, we conducted a systematic literature review. Results Chemosignals derived from axillary odors collected under a variety of emotional stimuli and sad tears in humans affect receivers' social interactions, danger detection and risk-taking behavior, social aspects of eating, and performance under stressing conditions. In addition, beyond the fight-or-flight response, even the body odors of happiness can be perceived by others. Furthermore, human chemosignals can influence behaviors and stressful responses in animals, particularly dogs and horses, which may partially explain their special relationship with humans. Conclusion Our review highlights the importance of chemosignaling in human intra- and interspecific interactions and suggests the need for further investigations, both in physiological conditions and in patients with psychiatric or neurodegenerative disorders.",0

Background Burnout syndrome is a common occupational hazard for nursing staff. Mindfulness training has been proposed as a valid intervention for burnout. Design Systematic review and meta-analysis. Data sources The CINAHL, LILACS, Medline, ProQuest, PsycINFO, Scielo and Scopus databases were consulted, using the search equation 'Nurs * AND burnout AND mindfulness'. There was no restriction on the year of publication. Review methods Papers were selected for analysis in accordance with the PRISMA guidelines. The meta-analysis was carried out using Review Manager 5.3 software. Results The sample was of 17 articles including 632 nurses. Mindfulness training reduces levels of burnout, producing lower scores for emotional exhaustion and depersonalization and higher for personal accomplishment. The differences in the means were 1.32 (95% CI: -9.41-6.78), 1.91 (95% CI: -4.50-0.68) and 2.12 (95% CI: -9.91-14.14), respectively, between the intervention and control groups.

No direct comparisons have been performed among these treatment options. We performed a systematic review and network meta-analysis to compare and rank the available regimens for first-line treatment in terms of survival benefit and efficacy. In accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review statement, a systematic search of reported studies was performed in MEDLINE, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and EMBASE up to May 31, 2019. Network meta-analysis models were adjusted using the Bayesian method. Four randomized clinical trials, with a total of 3758 patients, met the inclusion criteria. Considering systemic therapy, 1880 patients had received sunitinib and 550, 432, 442, and 454 patients had received ipilimumab plus nivolumab (ipi + nivo), pembrolizumab plus axitinib (pembro + axi), avelumab plus axitinib (avelu + axi), and atezolizumab plus bevacizumab (atezo + bev). No difference was found in overall survival between ipi + nivo and pembro + axi for the intention to treat population (hazard ratio [HR], 1.34; 95% credible interval [CrI], 0.92-1.97). No difference was found in progression-free survival among the treatments. The overall response rate (ORR) was superior with pembro + axi and avelu + axi compared with the ORR with the other treatments (atezo + bev vs. pembro + axi: HR, 0.66; 95% CrI, 0.52-0.84; ipi + nivo vs. pembro + axi: HR, 0.73; 95% CrI, 0.59-0.90; atezo + bev vs. avelu + axi: HR, 0.55; 95% CrI, 0.43-0.71; avelu + axi vs. ipi + nivo: HR, 1.66; 95% CrI, 1.31-2.12), with no differences across them (HR, 1.21; 95% CrI, 0.95-1.53). In the present indirect comparison, for an intention to treat population, we found no survival differences between pembro + axi and ipi + nivo. All treatments showed better progression-free survival compared with sunitinib that was similar among them. The combination of an IO agent (pembrolizumab or avelumab) and axitinib seemed to be the most effective therapy for the ORR.",0

Local therapies targeting these margins could impact on recurrence. This study analysed recurrence-patterns to identify whether strategies to control local disease could have a meaningful impact.(I) Systematic review to define recurrence patterns and resection margin status. (II) Additional retrospective study of PD performed at our centre.In the systematic review, 23/617 evaluated studies were included (n = 3815). Local recurrence was observed in 7-69%. SMA margin (6 studies) was positive in 15-35%. In the retrospective study (n = 204), local recurrence was more frequently observed with a positive SMA margin (66 vs.45%; p = 0.005). Furthermore, in a multivariate cox-proportional hazard model, only a positive SMA margin was associated with disease recurrence (HR 1.615; 95%CI 1.127-2.315; p = 0.009). Interestingly, median overall survival was 20 months and similar for patients who developed local only, metastases only or simultaneous recurrence (p = 0.124).Local recurrence of pancreatic cancer is common and associated with similar mortality rates as those who present with simultaneous or metastatic recurrence. Involvement of the SMA margin is an independent predictor for disease progression and should be the target of future adjuvant local therapies.",0

Their surgical and adjuvant management is unclear.Our goal was to update Rades et al.'s 2006 systematic review to assess the outcome differences among 3 fundamental therapies for CNC: gross total resection with and without radiation therapy (RT) versus maximal safe resection with adjuvant RT.Articles indexed on PubMed and Google Scholar and published between January 1, 2006 and December 31, 2019 were selected using the PRISMA criteria. Studies were excluded if they had fewer than 3 cases, did not categorize extent of resection, or were duplicate studies, technical reports, case reports, or studies without follow-up. Complication rates, recurrence rates, overall survival and progression-free survival were extracted where possible. χ2 proportionality tests were used for comparison (P values >0.05 suggested significance).On aggregation, 615 patients from 13 studies including ours were assessed. Although overall survival was not significantly different (χ2 = 1.56; P = 0.46), the recurrence rate differed significantly between GTR + RT (6.9%, 92.11 months), GTR-RT (23.9%, 96.8 months), and MSR + RT (16.8%, 85 months) (χ2 = 10.94; P = 0.004). Pooled complication rates for GTR and MSR + RT were 31.2% and 24% (P = 0.049), respectively.RT remains an important adjuvant treatment that can improve patient survival in the presence of MSR to levels comparable to those of GTR or GTR + RT. Where total resection carries too much risk, MSR + RT can be considered as the next best alternative for tumor control.",0

The aim of this systematic review is to synthesize the empirical literature examining the relationship between prenatal and postnatal low blood lead levels and executive function across childhood development. This review considers the unity and diversity model of executive functioning by assessing the domains of working memory, cognitive flexibility, inhibition, attention, and unitary executive function separately. Nineteen studies met the inclusion criteria and were synthesized in the review. The results suggest an inverse association between postnatal lead exposure and executive function processes across childhood. The inverse relationship between postnatal lead exposure and working memory and cognitive flexibility in middle childhood is most strongly represented. Additionally, a marginal inverse relationship between postnatal lead exposure and unitary executive functioning and attention in middle childhood is suggested. The evidence does not support a relationship between postnatal lead and inhibition in middle childhood. Although there is support for the inverse relationship between low level lead exposure and executive function, lack of repeated exposure and outcome measures limit firm conclusions. Furthermore, the long-term impact of lead exposure on executive function outcomes is relatively unknown given lack of studies on adolescent populations.",0

Our objective was to identify the prevalence, incidence, and degree of carotid stenosis in patients with a history of head and neck irradiation. Methods This study was performed according to the PRISMA guidelines. A random effects model meta-analysis was conducted. Results Nineteen studies comprising 1479 patients were included. The prevalence of carotid stenosis >50%, >70%, and carotid occlusion was 25% (95% CI: 19%-32%), 12% (95% CI: 7%-17%), and 4% (95% CI: 2%-8%), respectively. The cumulative 12-month incidence of carotid stenosis >50% was 4% (95% CI: 2%-5%), the 24-month was 12% (95% CI: 9%-15%), and the 36-month was 21% (95% CI: 9%-36%). Conclusions The yearly incidence of carotid stenosis >50% increased every year during the first 3 years following radiotherapy. We propose routine yearly Doppler ultrasound screening beginning 1 year after head and neck radiotherapy.",0
https://doi.org/10.1071/sh19150,Prevalence of sexually transmissible infections and HIV in men attending sex-on-premises venues in Australia: a systematic review and meta-analysis of observational studies,"Background In Australia, men who have sex with men (MSM) have high rates sexually transmissible infections (STIs) and sex-on-premises venue (SOPV) patrons are at risk. This paper assesses Neisseria gonorrhoeae (NG), Chlamydia trachomatis (CT), syphilis and HIV prevalence in men tested at Australian SOPVs and describes testing services. Methods: EMBASE, Medline, PubMed and international conference proceedings were searched for articles reporting on-site SOPV testing between 1 January 2000 and 31 January 2017. Meta-analysis calculated pooled prevalence estimates of STIs by anatomical site. Results: Twelve cross-sectional studies were identified. Most (8/12) were local sexual health clinics (SHC) outreach services. Participants’ mean age was 41.1 years (95% confidence interval (CI) 37.0–43.3; range 17 to 84 years). Testing included CT and NG (9/12), HIV (8/12) and syphilis (5/12). CT and NG prevalence overall summary estimates were 3.4% (95% CI 1.9–5.2%, I2 = 88.7%, P &amp;lt; 0.01) and 1.3% (95% CI 0.7–2.2%, I2 = 75.5%, P &amp;lt; 0.01) respectively. CT and NG prevalence was highest in the ano-rectum and oro-pharynx respectively. The HIV and syphilis pooled estimates were 2.3% (95% CI 1.6–2.9%, I2 = 93.1%, P &amp;lt; 0.01) and 3.2% (95% CI 1.8–4.6%, I2 = 72.8%, P &amp;lt; 0.01) respectively. Participation rate varied. Conclusion: This review examines HIV and STI testing in Australian SOPVs before HIV pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP). Findings indicate a high prevalence of STIs. PrEP use and resultant condomless sex may influence STI prevalence. Further research is required to determine the effect of PrEP on the STI prevalence among SOPV patrons.",0
https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jshs.2020.03.007,Tai Ji Quan as antihypertensive lifestyle therapy: A systematic review and meta-analysis,"Abstract Background Professional health organizations are not currently recommending Tai Ji Quan alongside aerobic exercise to treat hypertension. We aimed to examine the efficacy of Tai Ji Quan as antihypertensive lifestyle therapy. Methods Tai Ji Quan interventions published in English and Chinese were included when they involved healthy adults, reported pre- and post-intervention blood pressure (BP), and had a non-exercise/non-diet control group. We systematically searched 11 electronic databases for studies published through July 31, 2018, yielding 31 qualifying controlled trials. We (1) evaluated the risk of bias and methodological study quality, (2) performed meta-regression analyses following random-effects assumptions, and (3) generated additive models representing the largest possible clinically relevant BP reductions. Results Participants (n = 3223) were middle-aged (56.6 ± 15.1 years of age, mean ± SD) adults with prehypertension (systolic BP (SBP) = 136.9 ± 15.2 mmHg, diastolic BP (DBP) = 83.4 ± 8.7 mmHg). Tai Ji Quan was practiced 4.0 ± 1.4 sessions/week for 54.0 ± 10.6 min/session for 22.3 ± 20.2 weeks. Overall, Tai Ji Quan elicited significant reductions in SBP (–11.3 mmHg, 95%CI: –14.6 to –8.0; d+ = –0.75) and DBP (–4.8 mmHg, 95%CI: –6.4 to –3.1; d+ = –0.53) vs. control (p Conclusion Our results indicate that Tai Ji Quan is a viable antihypertensive lifestyle therapy that produces clinically meaningful BP reductions (i.e., 10.4 mmHg and 4.0 mmHg of SBP and DBP reductions, respectively) among individuals with hypertension. Such magnitude of BP reductions can lower the incidence of cardiovascular disease by up to 40%.",0
https://doi.org/10.1007/s00464-019-07365-x,Objective assessment of surgical operative performance by observational clinical human reliability analysis (OCHRA): a systematic review,"Both morbidity and mortality data (MMD) and learning curves (LCs) do not provide information on the nature of intraoperative errors and their mechanisms when these adversely impact on patient outcome. OCHRA was developed specifically to address the unmet surgical need for an objective assessment technique of the quality of technical execution of operations at individual operator level. The aim of this systematic review was to review of OCHRA as a method of objective assessment of surgical operative performance.Systematic review based on searching 4 databases for articles published from January 1998 to January 2019. The review complies with Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines and includes original publications on surgical task performance based on technical errors during operations across several surgical specialties.Only 26 published studies met the search criteria, indicating that the uptake of OCHRA during the study period has been low. In 31% of reported studies, the operations were performed by fully qualified consultant/attending surgeons and by surgical trainees in 69% in approved training programs. OCHRA identified 7869 consequential errors (CE) during the conduct of 719 clinical operations (mean = 11 CEs). It also identified 'hazard zones' of operations and proficiency-gain curves (P-GCs) that confirm attainment of persistent competent execution of specific operations by individual trainee surgeons. P-GCs are both surgeon and operation specific.Increased OCHRA use has the potential to improve patient outcome after surgery, but this is a contingent progress towards automatic assessment of unedited videos of operations. The low uptake of OCHRA is attributed to its labor-intensive nature involving human factors (cognitive engineering) expertise. Aside from faster and more objective peer-based assessment, this development should accelerate increased clinical uptake and use of the technique in both routine surgical practice and surgical training.",0

We systematically reviewed the literature and identified 21 papers which fulfilled inclusion and exclusion criteria. The majority of the studies found significant association between mother–infant interaction and language, cognition, motor, and social development during the first year of life. Only seven studies assessed motor development and four studies found significant relationship between motor development and mother–infant interaction. Prematurity, infant age, multiples births, maternal anxiety, maternal opioid exposure, history of foster care, and criminal record were the only factors found to mediate the relationship between mother–infant interaction and social, cognitive, and language development. The quality of the interactions between a mother and infant can both positively and negatively influence cognitive, language, and social outcomes during the first year of life. Additional research is needed to determine the influence of mother–infant interaction on motor development. Future research is needed on the efficacy of interventions designed to alter mother–infant interaction with the ultimate goal of achieving positive developmental outcomes during the first year of life.",0

[Methods] Randomized and non-randomized clinical trials published between January 1997 and October 2019 were selected by searching four scientific databases. We included studies on patients with Down syndrome involving gait analysis or postural control. A custom data-extraction and appraisal form was developed to collect the key features of each article. The PEDro Scale was used to evaluate the methodological quality of the studies. [Results] A total of 37 out of 146 cross-sectional and longitudinal studies were included in the review. The main abnormalities included: reduction of gait velocity and step length, poor static balance with increased anteroposterior and mediolateral oscillations and a larger step width. [Conclusion] A number of compensatory patterns during movement was observed, with a direct influence on improvements in stability and postural control throughout daily life. Intensive gait training at an early age appears to produce long-term improvements in this population. Future research should focus on the interaction between the motor and cognitive function, and on the functional effects due to the exposure to an enriched environment.",0

It is related to unfavorable outcomes in various cardiovascular conditions. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of the association of frailty with all-cause mortality and bleeding after acute myocardial infarction (AMI) in the elderly.We comprehensively searched the databases of MEDLINE and EMBASE from inception to March 2019. The studies that reported mortality and bleeding in AMI patients who were evaluated and classified by frailty status were included. Data from each study were combined using the random-effects, generic inverse variance method of DerSimonian and Laird to calculate hazard ratio (HR), and 95% confidence interval (CI).Twenty-one studies from 2011 to 2019 were included in this meta-analysis involving 143,301 subjects (mean age 75.33-year-old, 60.0% male). Frailty status was evaluated using different methods such as Fried Frailty Index. Frailty was statistically associated with increased early mortality in nine studies (pooled HR = 2.07, 95% CI: 1.67-2.56, P < 0.001, I2 = 41.2%) and late mortality in 11 studies (pooled HR = 2.30, 95% CI: 1.70-3.11, P < 0.001, I2 = 65.8%). Moreover, frailty was also statistically associated with higher bleeding in 7 studies (pooled HR = 1.34, 95% CI: 1.12-1.59, P < 0.001, I2 = 4.7%).Frailty is strongly and independently associated with bleeding, early and late mortality in elderly with AMI. Frailty assessment should be considered as an additional risk factor and used to guide toward personalized treatment strategies.",0
https://doi.org/10.1186/s12883-020-01680-w,Investigatory pathway and principles of patient selection for epilepsy surgery candidates: a systematic review,"Abstract Background The predominant treatment for epilepsy is pharmacotherapy, yet 20–40% do not respond to anti-epileptic drugs. After becoming pharmacoresistant, some patients are worked-up to determine candidacy for epilepsy surgery. Despite the 2009 American Epilepsy Society guidelines, there is no broadly accepted criteria for the investigatory pathway and principles of patient selection for epilepsy surgery candidates. The objective of this systematic review is to elucidate what diagnostic pathways clinicians globally utilize. Methods Utilizing the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) and the Cochrane Handbook of Systemic Reviews of Interventions, we conducted a systematic review through MEDLINE, Embase, and CENTRAL. Results From 2092 screened articles, 14 met inclusion criteria for qualitative synthesis. Structural MRI was required in all investigatory pathways. All but two articles required neuropsychological assessment. Six required neuropsychiatric assessment. Two protocols mentioned assessing the patient’s support network. Three other protocols mentioned discussing expectations with patients. One also motioned conducing an occupational evaluation and making all surgery decisions in a multidisciplinary management conference. fMRI and the Wada test were required assessments in seven of the protocols. [18F]FDG-PET and SPECT were ancillary for all but three articles (where they were required). MEG and intracranial EEG were only mentioned as ancillary. Magnetic resonance (MR) spectroscopy was required at two institutes. With regards to the actual indication for selecting patients to begin the investigatory pathway, seven of the articles used a variation of the International League Against Epilepsy definition of refectory epilepsy, while one incorporated patient social history. Conclusions Despite attempts to standardize patient selection and investigatory pathways, no two protocols were identical. Scalp video/EEG telemetry, structural MRI, and neuropsychological assessment were the only assessments utilized in nearly all protocols. Socioeconomic restrictions appear to play a role in determining which tests are utilized in the investigatory pathway—not just for developing countries. However, cost-effective assessments, such as assessing patient support network and providing realistic expectation of outcomes, were only utilized in few protocols. In addition, no advanced imaging technologies (i.e., qMRI, 3D-MMI) were utilized. Overall, even amongst expert examiners there is significant variation throughout epilepsy centers globally, in selecting candidates and working up patients.",0
https://doi.org/10.1007/s00198-020-05429-6,Exposure to heavy metals and the risk of osteopenia or osteoporosis: a systematic review and meta-analysis,"The relationship between heavy metal exposure and risk of osteopenia or osteoporosis has biological plausibility, yet it remains inconclusive; therefore, we conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to evaluate the associations between exposure to heavy metals (i.e., cadmium, lead, and mercury) and the risk of osteopenia or osteoporosis. Databases of MEDLINE, Embase, Scopus, and Web of Science were searched through November 2019, to identify studies that evaluated the relationship between exposure to cadmium, lead, and mercury and risk of osteopenia or osteoporosis in adults. Fourteen eligible studies were included. Effect sizes expressed as pooled odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were estimated using weighted random-effect models. Exposure to cadmium (OR = 1.35; 95% CI: 1.17 to 1.56; P ≤ 0.001) and lead (OR = 1.15; 95% CI: 1.00 to 1.32; P = 0.05) was associated with an increased risk of osteopenia or osteoporosis, unlike mercury. Subgroup analyses showed cadmium exposure increased the risk of osteopenia or osteoporosis in older (> 65 yrs.; OR = 1.43; 95%CI: 1.08 to 1.88, P = 0.01) compared with younger (18-65 yrs.; OR = 1.24; 95% CI: 1.02 to 1.52, P = 0.03) adults. Also, lead exposure increased the risk in men (OR = 1.55; 95% CI: 1.15 to 2.09, P = 0.007) unlike in women. By contrast to urinary levels, blood (OR = 1.26; 95% CI: 1.08 to 1.47, P = 0.003) and dietary (OR = 1.46; 95% CI: 1.28 to 1.67, P < 0.001) levels of cadmium were associated with an increased risk of osteopenia or osteoporosis. Exposure to cadmium and lead may be associated with an increased risk of osteopenia or osteoporosis, although high heterogeneity was detected.",1

For most patients, these reflect non-specialist rather than specialist palliative care needs. Embedding palliative care principles early in patients’ disease trajectories within acute care delivery in hospitals, however, is a challenge. How to best understand the experiences of those providing non-specialist palliative care in hospitals has not been systematically assessed. Aim: To synthesise the evidence on healthcare providers’ views and experiences of non-specialist palliative care in hospitals. Design: A qualitative systematic review and thematic synthesis using Thomas and Harden’s thematic synthesis framework. Data sources: Databases of MEDLINE, CINAHL, PsycINFO and EMBASE were searched from date of inception to March 2018. Studies were eligible for inclusion if they reported on healthcare providers’ views and experiences of non-specialist palliative care in hospitals. Studies were appraised for quality but not excluded on that basis. The review was prospectively registered with the International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews. Results: Thirty-nine papers of 37 studies were included, representing 985 hospital healthcare providers’ views and experiences. Four major analytical themes emerged; ‘Understanding of Palliative Care’, ‘Complexities of Communication’, ‘Hospital Ecosystem’ and ‘Doctors and Nurses – a Different Lens’. Conclusions: Non-specialist palliative care in hospitals is operationalised as care in the last weeks and days of life. The organisation of acute care, inter-disciplinary working practices, clinician attitudes, poor communication structures and lack of education and training in palliative care principles exacerbates poor implementation of this care earlier for patients in hospitals.",0

Mechanistic simulation modeling that captures the dynamics between patients, pathogens, and the environment is increasingly being used to improve understanding of epidemiological patterns of HAIs and to facilitate decisions on infection prevention and control (IPC). The purpose of this review is to present a systematic review to establish (1) how simulation models have been used to investigate HAIs and their mitigation and (2) how these models have evolved over time, as well as identify (3) gaps in their adoption and (4) useful directions for their future development. <h3>Methods</h3> The review involved a systematic search and identification of studies using system dynamics, discrete event simulation, and agent-based model to study HAIs. <h3>Results</h3> The complexity of simulation models developed for HAIs significantly increased but heavily concentrated on transmission dynamics of methicillin-resistant <i>Staphylococcus aureus</i> in the hospitals of high-income countries. Neither HAIs in other health care settings, the influence of contact networks within a health care facility, nor patient sharing and referring networks across health care settings were sufficiently understood. <h3>Conclusions</h3> This systematic review provides a broader overview of existing simulation models in HAIs to identify the gaps and to direct and facilitate further development of appropriate models in this emerging field.",0

In the overall population PS ≥ 2 resulted in worse OS, PFS and ORR (OS pooled hazard ratio of 2.72; 95% CI: 2.03–3.63; <i>I</i><sup>2</sup> 72.70%, <i>p</i> < 0.001; PFS pooled hazard ratio of 2.39; 95% CI 1.81–3.15, <i>p</i> < 0.0001; <i>I</i><sup>2</sup> 73.03%; ORR pooled odds ratio 0.25; 95% CI 0.11–0.56, <i>p</i> 0.001; <i>I</i><sup>2</sup> 0.00%). <h3>Conclusion</h3> ECOG PS ≥ 2 retains an important prognostic validity in patients treated with ICI similar, in terms of effect size, to that reported for chemotherapy in NSCLC. The high level of heterogeneity for OS and PFS analysis (but not for ORR), not completely explained by the different proportion of ECOG 3−4 patients (ranging from 0% to 50% of the PS ≥ 2 population), could be the result of both patient heterogeneity within the PS 2 population and the subjectivity of ECOG PS assessment. Whether poorer PS is also a predictor of lower immunotherapy efficacy remains still to be demonstrated.",0
https://doi.org/10.1007/s11356-020-07989-w,A systematic review and meta-analysis of lead and cadmium concentrations in cow milk in Iran and human health risk assessment,"The aim of the current research was to systematically review and summarize the studies that evaluated the concentration of lead (Pb) and cadmium (Cd) in cow milk in different regions of Iran and to perform a meta-analysis of the findings. Moreover, the non-carcinogenic and carcinogenic risks of Pb and Cd through milk consumption in adult and child consumers were assessed. As a result of a systematic search in the international and national databases between January 2008 and October 2018, 17 reports involving 1874 samples were incorporated in our study for meta-analysis. The pooled concentrations of Pb and Cd were estimated to be 13.95 μg mL−1 (95% CI 9.72–18.11 μg mL−1) and 3.55 μg mL−1 (95% CI − 2.38–9.48 μg mL−1), respectively, which were lower than the WHO/FAO and national standard limits. The estimated weekly intake (EWI) of Pb and Cd through consuming milk was 16.65 and 7 μg day−1 for adults of 70 kg and 45 and 34 μg day−1 for children of 26 kg, respectively, which was well below the risk values set by Joint FAO/WHO Expert Committee on Food Additives (JECFA). The maximum target hazard quotient values (THQs) of Pb and Cd were 5.55E−5 and 5.55E−5 for adults and 5.55E−5 and 5.55E−5 for children, respectively, which were lower than 1 value, suggesting that Iranian consumers are not exposed to non-carcinogenic risk through consuming milk. Moreover, the incremental lifetime cancer risk (ILCR) of Pb estimated to be 2.96E−04 in adults and 1.0E−03 in children, indicating that consumers in Iran are at threshold carcinogenic risk of Pb through consuming milk (ILCR > 10−4). Therefore, planning and policy making for the sustainable reduction of these toxic metals in milk, particularly in industrial regions of Iran, are crucial.",0

The aim of this systematic review and meta-analysis was to evaluate the prevalence and incidence of fatty liver developed after tamoxifen treatment in breast cancer patients. Methods A systematic search of PubMed (Medline), EMBASE, OVID Medline, the Cochrane Library and other databases was performed for this review. The abstracts obtained from the search were reviewed by two investigators who chose manuscripts for full-text review. The event rates were calculated with a random-effects model and quality-effects model. Results The search yielded 165 references. Of these, 24 were included in the quantitative summary. We analysed the data of a total of 6,962 patients treated with tamoxifen and 975 patients not treated with tamoxifen. The prevalence of fatty liver among patients with breast cancer taking tamoxifen was 40.25 per 100 patients and the incidence rate was 12.37 per 100 person-years. The incidence of fatty liver was much higher in the tamoxifen group than in the control group [incidence rate ratio: 3.12, 95% CI (confidence interval): 2.05-4.75, I2 = 61%], regardless of region. The main risk factors were body mass index (BMI) [hazard ratio (HR): 1.15, 95% CI: 1.09-1.22] and hypercholesterolaemia (HR: 1.01, 95% CI: 1.00-1.02).

Online databases were searched on 31 Oct 2018. Results Twenty-five studies with a total of 11166 patients with melanoma were included. There was no significant difference in serum vitamin D levels between patients with melanoma and controls [standardized mean difference (SMD), -0.185; 95% confidence interval (CI), -0.533 to 0.162]. However, the prevalence of vitamin D deficiency was significantly higher in patients with melanoma than that in controls (odds ratio, 2.115; 95% CI, 1.151-3.885). In terms of prognosis, serum vitamin D levels were significantly higher in melanoma patients with lower Breslow thickness (≦1 vs. >1 mm: SMD, 0.243; 95% CI, 0.160-0.327). Moreover, melanoma patients with lower vitamin D levels had a significantly higher mortality rate (hazard ratio, 1.558; 95% CI, 1.258-1.931). Conclusions Vitamin D deficiency is associated with higher Breslow thickness and mortality in melanoma patients.",0

To understand nPEP awareness, uptake, and factors associated with uptake among MSM, we searched PubMed, Scopus, Embase, the Cochrane Library, and Web of Science for studies reporting nPEP implementation among MSM published before May 19, 2019. We estimated pooled rates and their 95% confidence intervals (CIs) of awareness, uptake using a random-effects model. We identified 74 studies: 3 studies (4.1%) from upper-middle-income regions and 71 (95.9%) from high-income regions. The pooled rate of nPEP awareness and uptake was 51.6% (95% CI 40.6-62.5%) and 6.0% (5.0-7.1%), respectively. Pooled uptake rate was higher in upper-middle-income regions [8.9% (7.8-10.0%)] than in high-income regions [5.8% (4.8-6.9%)]. Unprotected anal sex was the most common exposure (range: 55.0-98.6%, median: 62.9%). Pooled completion of nPEP was 86.9% (79.5-92.8%). Of 19,546 MSM prescribed nPEP, 500 HIV seroconversions (2.6%) were observed. Having risky sexual behaviors and history of sexually transmitted infections were associated with higher nPEP uptake, whereas insufficient knowledge, underestimated risk of exposure to HIV, lack of accessibility, and social stigma might hinder nPEP uptake. Awareness and uptake of nPEP among MSM worldwide are low. Further efforts are needed to combat barriers to access nPEP, including improving accessibility and reducing stigma. Seroconversions post-nPEP uptake suggest that joint prevention precautions aside from nPEP are needed for high-risk MSM. More evidence from low-income and middle-income regions is needed.",0

Mining the social media messages and updates can be helpful in understanding the emotional state of people during such unforeseen events as they are real-time data. The objective of this review is to explore the feasibility of using social media data for mental health surveillance as well as the techniques used for determining mental health using social media data during disasters. PubMed, PsycINFO, and PsycARTICLES databases were searched from 2009 to November 2018 for primary research studies. After screening and analyzing the records, 18 studies were included in this review. Twitter was the widely researched social media platform for understanding the mental health of people during a disaster. Psychological surveillance was done by identifying the sentiments expressed by people or the emotions they displayed in their social media posts. Classification of sentiments and emotions were done using lexicon-based or machine learning methods. It is not possible to conclude that a particular technique is the best performing one, because the performance of any method depends upon factors such as the disaster size, the volume of data, disaster setting, and the disaster web environment.",0

Primary outcomes were the urological manifestations of COVID-19, and SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA detection in urine and stool samples. Meta-analyses were performed when there were two or more studies reporting on the same outcome. Special considerations in urological conditions that were relevant in the pandemic of COVID-19 were reported in a narrative manner.There were a total of 21 studies with 3714 COVID-19 patients, and urinary symptoms were absent in all of them. In patients with COVID-19, 7.58% (95% CI 3.30-13.54%) developed acute kidney injury with a mortality rate of 93.27% (95% CI 81.46-100%) amongst them. 5.74% (95% CI 2.88-9.44%) of COVID-19 patients had positive viral RNA in urine samples, but the duration of viral shedding in urine was unknown. 65.82% (95% CI 45.71-83.51%) of COVID-19 patients had positive viral RNA in stool samples, which were detected from 2 to 47 days from symptom onset. 31.6% of renal transplant recipients with COVID-19 required non-invasive ventilation, and the overall mortality rate was 15.4%.Acute kidney injury leading to mortality is common amongst COVID-19 patients, likely as a result of direct viral toxicity. Viral RNA positivity was detected in both urine and stool samples, so precautions are needed when we perform transurethral or transrectal procedures.",0

The goal of this study is to detect the impact of RDW on the prognosis of PH.PubMed and EMBASE databases were searched from their inception to July 22, 2019 for relevant publications reporting the relationship between RDW and the prognosis of PH. A meta-analysis was performed, and the heterogeneity across the included studies was evaluated using I and Q statistics. We conducted sensitivity and subgroup analyses to detect sources of heterogeneity. In addition, potential publication bias was evaluated by Begg's and Egger's tests.In total, 1236 publications were retrieved, and 7 eligible publications with 666 PH patients were included in our meta-analysis. The results suggested that increased RDW can predict worse prognosis in PH (hazard ratio (HR) = 1.27, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.11-1.45). According to subgroup analysis, study design, region, various endpoints, time of follow-up, and patient age were not sources of heterogeneity. In addition, RDW showed prognostic value in retrospective studies (HR = 1.32, 95%CI 1.15-1.51) but not in prospective studies (HR = 1.14, 95%CI 0.78-1.67). Additionally, RDW may serve as a predictive biomarker of PH in Europe (HR = 1.33, 95%CI 1.18-1.49) but not in Asia (HR = 1.20, 95%CI 0.90-1.58). Further analysis indicated that the prognostic value of RDW was influenced by patient age (>44 years: HR = 1.34, 95%CI 1.17-1.55; ≤44 years: HR = 1.20, 95%CI 0.90-1.58) and follow-up (<3 years, HR = 1.36, 95%CI 0.53-3.47; ≥3 years, HR = 1.29, 95%CI 1.14-1.45).RDW provides important prognostic information for PH patients, and this measure may be used to optimize patient management and guide clinical treatment.PROSPERO registration number: CRD42019122636.",0

The study was conducted and reported according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. Sixty-nine studies were included in the quantitative synthesis, and separate meta-analyses were conducted for the outcomes self-reported craving and objective food intake. Results show small to medium positive effects across specific craving interventions on both outcomes. Effect sizes were partly moderated by intervention type. The most effective intervention regarding food intake was in sensu cue exposure. For subjective craving, the most robust evidence was found for beneficial effects of cognitive regulation strategies (ie, reappraisal, suppression, and distraction). Results further indicate that training inhibitory control through behavioral inhibition might be more effective than approach-avoidance training when considering its effect on subjective craving and food intake. People with external eating habits, overeating, or loss-of-control eating might benefit from these types of specific craving interventions. Future research should focus on long-term effects, transferability, and effectiveness in clinical samples.",0

Apesar de sua etiologia ainda ser desconhecida, cada vez mais estudos têm demonstrado o papel preponderante de fatores genéticos em detrimento de fatores ambientais. Com o objetivo de revisar o conhecimento atual sobre os genes associados à degeneração do disco intervertebral, foi realizada uma revisão narrativa da literatura inglesa nos últimos 10 anos sobre o tema. Concluímos que há uma série de genes que foram associados à degeneração discal em seres humanos, incluindo genes codificando colágeno I α-1 (COL1A1), colágeno IX (COL9A2 e COL9A3), colágeno XI (COL11A2), interleucina 6 (IL-6), agrecano (AGC1), receptor de vitamina D (VDR), metaloproteinase de matriz 3 (MMP-3), além de microRNAs. Dessa forma, a presente revisão enfatiza os últimos avanços na associação de genes com fenótipos de discos degenerados específicos, polimorfismos de nucleotídeos únicos, hereditariedade e interações genético-ambientais em relação à degeneração discal, com o intuito de permitir ao clínico entender esse mecanismo de degeneração e estar preparado para as novas terapêuticas que estão por vir baseadas na genética.",0

This association suggests the need for further investigations on non-genetic risk factors. Identifying these risk factors is a public health priority in order to develop prevention strategies aimed at reducing the prevalence and health consequences in offspring. Objective To systematically assess and quantitatively synthesise the available epidemiological studies to evaluate the association between non-genetic risk factors and gastroschisis. Methods Literature from PubMed, EMBASE and Scopus was searched for the period 1990–2018. Epidemiological studies reporting risk estimates between lifestyle and sociodemographic risk factors and gastroschisis were included. Two pairs of reviewers independently extracted information on study characteristics following Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses and MOOSE (Meta-analysis Of Oservational Studies in Epidemiology) guidelines. Relative risk (RR) estimates were calculated across the studies and meta-analysis was performed using random-effects model. Results We identified 58 studies. Meta-analyses were conducted on 29 studies. Maternal smoking (RR 1.56, 95% CI 1.40 to 1.74), illicit drug use (RR 2.14, 95% CI 1.48 to 3.07) and alcohol consumption (RR 1.40, 95% CI 1.13 to 1.70) were associated with an increased risk of gastroschisis. A decreased risk among black mothers compared with non-Hispanic white mothers (RR 0.49, 95% CI 0.38 to 0.63) was found. For Hispanic mothers no association was observed. Conclusions Exposure to smoking, illicit drugs and alcohol during pregnancy is associated with an increased risk of gastroschisis. A significantly decreased risk for black mothers was observed. Further epidemiological studies to assess the potential role of other environmental factors are strongly recommended. PROSPERO registration number CRD42018104284.",0

However, it is unclear what facilitators and barriers professionals experience when providing this integrated care. Our systematic review, including 55 studies from a broad variety of settings in Youth Care, showed that integrated care on a professional level is a multi-component entity consisting of several facilitators and barriers. Findings were clustered in seven general themes: 'Child's environment', 'Preconditions', 'Care process', 'Expertise', 'Interprofessional collaboration', 'Information exchange', and 'Professional identity'. The identified facilitators and barriers were generally consistent across studies, indicating broad applicability across settings and professional disciplines. This review clearly shows that when Youth Care professionals address a broad spectrum of problems, a variety of facilitators and barriers should be considered.Registration PROSPERO, registration number CRD42018084527.",0

Numerous studies have been conducted about the feasibility of using clinical ultrasound to assess scoliosis; thus, an inclusive review of the literature would be beneficial for researchers, clinicians and patients. This study aimed to systematically review the reliability and validity of coronal curvature assessments obtained from different clinical ultrasound imaging methods. A comprehensive search of 6 databases and Google Scholar search engine was performed for retrieving articles assessing reliability and/or validity of spinal curvature measurements obtained from clinical ultrasound. Two reviewers assessed the methodological quality of selected articles independently using criteria appraisal instrument. The results were analysed and synthesized qualitatively using level of evidence method. Fourteen articles were included. Thirteen articles investigated both the reliability and validity, of which nine were of high quality; and one article evaluated only the reliability and was of high quality. Totally five ultrasound methods were evaluated. Very high reliability (intra-class correlation coefficient = 0.80–1.00) but limited levels of evidence were found for the majority of the studied ultrasound methods. Almost all the methods showed good to excellent validity (correlation coefficient = 0.76–1.00) but limited to moderate levels of evidence. A high level of evidence was found in support of the reliability and validity of the COL (centre of lamina) ultrasound method. Further reliability and validity studies should be conducted to strengthen the level of evidence for those ultrasound methods with moderate, limited or conflicting level of evidence.

Materials and Methods A systematic literature review (PubMed and Embase indexed from January 1, 1980, to May 1, 2020) of studies describing PIFs that result from radiation therapy for gynecologic malignancies. A random-effects model weighted by the inverse variance was used to calculate the pooled crude incidence, actuarial incidence, and proportion of symptomatic PIFs, and to evaluate the relationship between PIF incidence and various risk factors. Results Thirty-eight studies describing PIFs following radiation therapy for gynecologic malignancies were reviewed. A meta-analysis of 6488 patients (37 studies) identified the crude incidence of PIF as 9.4% (95% confidence interval [CI] 6.8%-12.4%), and a meta-analysis of 2131 patients (9 studies) identified the 5-year actuarial incidence of PIF as 15.3% (95% CI 7.5%-25.0%).

We aimed to provide the first estimation on the prevalence, number of cases, and risk factors for carotid atherosclerosis in the general population globally and regionally.In this systematic review, meta-analysis, and modelling study, we searched PubMed, MEDLINE, Embase, Global Health, and China National Knowledge Infrastructure for articles published from database inception until May 7, 2019, with no language restrictions, for population-based studies that quantified prevalence of carotid atherosclerosis by means of increased carotid intima-media thickness, carotid plaque, and carotid stenosis. Studies were eligible if they included bilaterally scanned carotid arteries using ultrasonography and defined increased carotid intima-media thickness as a thickness of 1·0 mm or more, carotid plaque as a focal carotid intima-media thickness of 1·5 mm or more encroaching into the lumen or at least 0·5 mm or 50% compared with the surrounding carotid intima-media thickness values, and carotid stenosis as 50% or more stenosis. Studies were excluded if the sample was not representative of the general population. We also included studies identified in our previous systematic review and meta-analysis of the prevalence of carotid atherosclerosis in China. We estimated age-specific and sex-specific prevalences of increased carotid intima-media thickness, carotid plaque, and carotid stenosis. We used UN population data to generate the number of people affected in 2000, 2015, and 2020. We did random-effects meta-analyses to assess the effects of risk factors for increased carotid intima-media thickness and carotid plaque. We derived regional numbers of people living with increased carotid intima-media thickness and carotid plaque in 2015 using a risk factors-based model by WHO region. All analyses were done in populations aged 30-79 years due to availability of data. This systematic review and meta-analysis is registered online on PROSPERO, CRD42019134709.We identified 8632 articles through our database search, of which 515 were eligible for full-text review, including 37 articles from our previous study, and 59 articles were eligible for inclusion in our systematic review and meta-analysis. Overall, in people aged 30-79 years in 2020, the global prevalence of increased carotid intima-media thickness is estimated to be 27·6% (95% CI 16·9-41·3), equivalent to 1066·70 million affected people and a percentage change of 57·46% from 2000; of carotid plaque is estimated to be 21·1% (13·2-31·5), equivalent to 815·76 million affected people and a percentage change of 58·97% from 2000; and carotid stenosis is estimated to be 1·5% (1·1-2·1), equivalent to 57·79 million affected people and a percentage change of 59·13% from 2000. The prevalence of increased carotid intima-media thickness, carotid plaque, and carotid stenosis increased consistently with age and was higher in men than in women. Current smoking, diabetes, and hypertension were common risk factors for increased carotid intima-media thickness and carotid plaque. In 2015, the Western Pacific region had the largest share of global cases of increased carotid intima-media thickness (317·62 million [33·36%] of 952·13 million affected people) and carotid plaque (240·77 million [33·20%] of 725·25 million), whereas the African region had the smallest share of cases of increased carotid intima-media thickness (59·08 million [6·21%]) and the Eastern Mediterranean region had the smallest share of carotid plaque cases (44·59 million [6·15%]).A substantial global burden of carotid atherosclerosis exists. Effective strategies are needed for primary prevention and management of carotid atherosclerosis. High-quality epidemiological investigations on carotid atherosclerosis are needed to better address the global burden of carotid atherosclerosis at finer levels.None.",0

Theoretical models highlight psychological processes of appraisals, memory, and coping as important for the development of PTSD. The aim of this review was to synthesize the literature on the role of these key psychological processes in relation to PTSD in maltreated children and teens. Studies were included if they (1) identified a sample of maltreated individuals, ≤18 years old; (2) measured (a) trauma memory, (b) appraisals, or (c) post-trauma cognitive or behavioral responses; and (3) measured PTSD symptoms. The systematic search of three electronic databases (American Psychological Association PsychNet, PubMed, and Published International Literature on Traumatic Stress) resulted in the inclusion of 36 papers, which described 31 studies and 33 unique samples. The review found cognitive behavioral models of PTSD appeared appropriate for understanding outcomes following maltreatment, but further research is needed on all processes, particularly trauma memory. Overall, there remain significant gaps in our knowledge of how psychological processes link maltreatment to PTSD. There is limited evidence concerning how maltreatment-related characteristics (e.g., chronicity, duration, and type of abuse) influence psychological processes and in turn affect outcomes. This review recommends further research in this area and suggests that, at the very least, comprehensive assessment should be conducted with all young people reporting maltreatment to identify appraisals and coping strategies that will potentially impact on their ongoing adjustment.",0

The aim of this work was to systematize our knowledge about the development of pain responses in prematurely born neonates by focusing on some key methodological issues. Studies on the impact of age variables, namely gestational age (GA), postmenstrual age (PMA) and chronological age (CH), on pain responsivity in premature neonates were identified using Medline and Scopus. Studies (N = 42) were categorized based on terminological and methodological approaches towards age variables, and according to output variables considered (facial, nonfacial behavioral, physiological). Distinct multidimensional developmental patterns were found for each age-sampling strategy. Overall, each of the three age variables seems to affect pain responsivity, possibly differently across age windows. Targeted as well as integrated approaches, together with a renewed attention for methodological consistency, are needed to further our knowledge on this topic.",0

Literature suggests that these somatic symptoms may be related to illness exposure in the family. Children with a parent or sibling with a chronic illness may be particularly vulnerable to developing somatic symptoms. This study provides a systematic review of the literature on somatic symptoms in children with a chronically ill family member.A systematic review (PROSPERO registry ID: CRD42018092344) was conducted using six databases (PubMed, EMBASE, PsychINFO, Scopus, CINAHL, and Cochrane) from articles published before April 5, 2018.

Relevant data were extracted by the first author and reviewed by remaining authors.Twenty-seven unique studies met the criteria. Seventeen examined somatic symptoms in children with a chronically ill parent, and seven evaluated somatic symptoms in children with a chronically ill sibling. Three studies examined somatic symptoms in children with an unspecified ill relative. The strongest relationship between child somatization and familial illness was found with children with a chronically ill parent (13/17 studies). Evidence for somatic symptoms in children with an ill sibling was mixed (4/7 studies found a positive association).The literature on somatic symptoms in children suggests that parental illness is related to increased somatic symptoms in children.

The objective of this study was to conduct a systematic review of smoking-cessation interventions for U.S. young adults (aged 18-24 years).Electronic searches were conducted in CINAHL, the Cochrane Library, EMBASE, PsycINFO, PubMed, Scopus, and Sociological Abstracts to identify eligible interventions through August 31, 2009. Two independent coders critically evaluated the methodology and findings of all retrieved articles. Data analysis was conducted in 2010.Twelve RCTs and two nonrandomized studies met the inclusion criteria; these studies varied with respect to sample size, intervention, outcomes assessed, and smoking measures. Pooled results for two studies based on social cognitive theory indicated that they were effective in promoting short-term abstinence at 1-3-month follow-up and 4-6-month follow-up. Four studies had a significant positive impact on smoking cessation: two in the short term and two at 6 months or more.There is limited evidence demonstrating efficacy of smoking-cessation interventions for U.S. young adults. There were no pharmacologic interventions included in this review. Promising interventions were brief, with extended support via telephone and electronic media. Further high-quality studies using standardized smoking measures and additional studies outside the college setting are needed to identify and tailor effective smoking-cessation interventions for at-risk young adults in the U.S.",0
https://doi.org/10.1038/s41430-020-0656-x,Effects of probiotics and paraprobiotics on subjective and objective sleep metrics: a systematic review and meta-analysis,"Inadequate sleep (i.e., duration and/or quality) is becoming increasingly recognized as a global public health issue. Interaction via the gut-brain axis suggests that modification of the gut microbial environment via supplementation with live microorganisms (probiotics) or nonviable microorganisms/microbial cell fractions (paraprobiotics) may improve sleep health. This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to clarify the effect of consuming probiotics/paraprobiotics on subjective and objective sleep metrics. Online databases were searched from 1980 to October 2019 for studies involving adults who consumed probiotics or paraprobiotics in controlled trials, during which, changes in subjective and/or objective sleep parameters were examined. A total of 14 studies (20 trials) were included in meta-analysis. Random effects meta-analyses indicated that probiotics/paraprobiotics supplementation significantly reduced Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) score (i.e., improved sleep quality) relative to baseline (−0.78-points, 95% confidence interval: 0.395–1.166; p < 0.001). No significant effect was found for changes on other subjective sleep scales, nor objective parameters of sleep (efficiency/latency) measured using polysomnography or actigraphy. Subgroup analysis for PSQI data suggested that the magnitude of the effect was greater (although not statistically) in healthy participants than those with a medical condition, when treatment contained a single (rather than multiple) strain of probiotic bacteria, and when the duration of treatment was ≥8 weeks. Probiotics/paraprobiotics supplementation may have some efficacy in improving perceived sleep health, measured using the PSQI. While current evidence does not support a benefit of consuming probiotics/paraprobiotics when measured by other subjective sleep scales, nor objective measures of sleep; more studies using well-controlled, within-subject experimental designs are needed.",0

Purpose : This systematic review and meta-analysis assessed the prognostic value of preoperative blood-based biomarkers in patients with upper tract urothelial carcinoma (UTUC) treated with nephroureterectomy. Methods : PUBMED, Web of Science, Cochrane Library, and Scopus databases were searched in June 2019 according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-analysis statement. Studies were deemed eligible if they compared cancer-specific survival in UTUC patients with and without pretreatment laboratory abnormalities. Formal meta-analyses were performed for this outcome. Results : The review identified 54 studies with 23,118 patients, of these, 52 studies with 22,513 patients were eligible for the meta-analysis. Several preoperative blood-based biomarkers were significantly associated with cancer-specific survival as follows: neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio (pooled hazard ratio [HR]: 1.66, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.34−2.06), C-reactive protein (pooled HR: 1.17, 95% CI: 1.07−1.29), platelet-lymphocyte ratio (pooled HR: 1.68, 95% CI: 1.30−2.17), white blood cell (pooled HR: 1.58, 95% CI: 1.02−2.46), De Ritis ratio (pooled HR: 2.40, 95% CI: 1.92−2.99), fibrinogen (pooled HR: 2.23, 95% CI: 1.86−2.68), albumin-globulin ratio (pooled HR: 3.00, 95% CI: 1.87−4.84), hemoglobin (pooled HR: 1.51, 95% CI: 1.22−1.87), and estimate glomerular filtration rate (pooled HR: 1.52, 95% CI: 1.19−1.94). The Cochrane's Q test and I 2 test revealed significant heterogeneity for neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio, C-reactive protein, white blood cell, hemoglobin, and estimated glomerular filtration rate ( P = 0.022; I 2 = 50.7%, P = 0.000; I 2 = 80.4%, P = 0.000; I 2 = 88.3%, P = 0.010; I 2 = 62.0%, P = 0.000; I 2 = 83.9%, respectively). Conclusions : Several pretreatment laboratory abnormalities in patients with UTUC were associated with increased risks of cancer-specific mortality. Therefore, blood-based biomarkers may have the potential to serve as prognostic factors to assist patients and physicians in selecting appropriate treatment strategies for UTUC. However, considering the study limitations including heterogeneity and retrospective nature of the primary data, the conclusions should be interpreted with caution.",0

https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cpr.2020.101851,Exposure therapy for eating disorders: A systematic review,"Abstract Exposure therapy is a potential method for the treatment of eating disorders. The current paper reviews the literature on exposure interventions for eating disorders, including studies (N = 60) on exposure and response prevention (ERP), in vivo feared food exposure, mirror exposure, family-based treatment with exposure, and virtual reality exposure therapy. Mirror exposure alone or in the context of cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) can decrease body dissatisfaction. The few controlled trials on ERP for binge and purge cues show only marginal benefit of ERP for binge or purge cues over and above other treatment methods such as CBT. In vivo exposure to feared foods may decrease state anxiety and increase caloric intake and body mass index, but research is limited. Virtual reality exposure could improve accessibility and feasibility of exposures in the clinical setting. A significant portion of the trials incorporated exposures into an overarching treatment such as CBT, body image therapy, or inpatient treatment, so the effects of exposure itself are difficult to parse apart. We discuss the state of the current literature in the context of learning theory and offer insights into new approaches to the application of exposure therapy in an eating disordered population.",0

A systematic review was conducted to evaluate the relationship between environmental NP exposure and cancer progression risk. Literature surveys were conducted within several international databases using appropriate keywords. A comprehensive search yielded 58 eligible studies involving a wide range of adverse effects, exposure assessment methods, study designs, and experimental models. Most studies reported that NP strongly induced breast cancer progression in intended experiments. Positive associations between NP exposure and ovarian, uterine, pituitary, and testicular cancers were also reported. Although some studies reported no relation between environmental NP exposure and tumour and/or cancer progression, NP (a known endocrine disrupting chemical) induced action mechanisms in multiple experimental models and may interfere with/hyper-activate oestrogen signalling. Secretion of oestrogen and development of reproductive tissues like breasts, uteruses, and ovaries showed strong associations with possible neoplasia (i.e., uncontrolled development of tumours and/or malignant cancers). Findings of this study are important for informing policymakers to pass legislation limiting the use of environmental contaminants such as NP before all adverse effects of exposure have been determined.",1
https://doi.org/10.1016/j.sapharm.2020.01.015,Sustainability of innovations in healthcare: A systematic review and conceptual framework for professional pharmacy services,"Abstract Background Implementation science emerged to address the challenges associated with the incorporation of evidence-based innovations into practice. Once the challenge is overcome, the ultimate goal is to achieve the sustainability of innovations to promote their continuity and long-term integration. Conceptual approaches and assessment tools have been designed to assess the sustainability of innovations in research and practice environments. However, the variability of approaches and tools available becomes a challenge for policymakers, researchers and practitioners, particularly when deciding how to evaluate the sustainability of innovations. Objectives To identify conceptual approaches and assessment tools for the sustainability of healthcare innovations and to develop a specific discipline-based framework for the sustainability of professional pharmacy services. Methods A systematic literature review was conducted in January of 2019 using PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science. General information regarding the conceptual approaches (based on Nilsen's classification), assessment tools and the factors affecting the sustainability of the healthcare innovations was retrieved. Results From 3123 articles screened, 132 articles were selected from which 106 conceptual approaches and 26 assessment tools were identified. Several key factors moderating the sustainability of the innovations in healthcare were identified (e.g. funding, adaptation). A framework for the sustainability of professional pharmacy services is proposed based on these factors. It presents three performance domains influencing the service sustainability (i.e. environment, social and economic). Conclusions The identified approaches in different healthcare settings have allowed the adaptation and design of a specific framework for pharmacy. The core factors included in the proposed framework are moderators of the sustainability process and should be considered in sustainability studies and evaluations. This framework will guide pharmacy practice researchers and practitioners to measure and achieve the sustainability of professional pharmacy services. Furthermore, the adaptation of this framework will allow its application to other healthcare settings. (Registration number CRD42018092160).",0
https://doi.org/10.1186/s12871-020-01023-9,Efficacy and safety of pulsed radiofrequency as a method of dorsal root ganglia stimulation for treatment of non-neuropathic pain: a systematic review,"Abstract Background We systematically reviewed the evidence on the efficacy and safety of dorsal root ganglion (DRG) targeted pulsed radiofrequency (PRF) versus any comparator for treatment of non-neuropathic pain. Methods We searched MEDLINE, CINAHL, Embase, PsycINFO, clinicaltrials.gov and WHO clinical trial register until January 8, 2019. All study designs were eligible. Two authors independently conducted literature screening. Primary outcomes were pain intensity and serious adverse events (SAEs). Secondary outcomes were any other pain-related outcome and any other safety outcome that was reported. We assessed the risk of bias using the Cochrane tool and Risk of Bias In Non-randomized Studies of Interventions (ROBINS-I). We conducted narrative evidence synthesis and assessed the conclusiveness of included studies regarding efficacy and safety. Results We included 17 studies with 599 participants, which analyzed various pain syndromes. Two studies were randomized controlled trials; both included participants with low back pain (LBP). Non-randomized studies included patients with the following indications: LBP, postsurgical pain, pain associated with herpes zoster, cervicogenic headache, complex regional pain syndrome type 1, intractable vertebral metastatic pain, chronic scrotal and inguinal pain, occipital radiating pain in rheumatoid arthritis and chronic migraine. In these studies, the PRF was usually initiated after other treatments have failed. Eleven studies had positive conclusive statements (11/17) about efficacy; the remaining had positive inconclusive statements. Only three studies provided conclusiveness of evidence statements regarding safety – two indicated that the evidence was positive conclusive, and one positive inconclusive. The risk of bias was predominantly unclear in randomized and serious in non-randomized studies. Conclusion Poor quality and few participants characterize evidence about benefits and harms of DRG PRF in patients with non-neuropathic pain. Results from available studies should only be considered preliminary. Not all studies have reported data regarding the safety of the intervention, but those that did, indicate that the intervention is relatively safe. As the procedure is non-destructive and early results are promising, further comparative studies about PRF in non-neuropathic pain syndromes would be welcomed.",0
https://doi.org/10.3390/nu12041062,That’s My Cue to Eat: A Systematic Review of the Persuasiveness of Front-of-Pack Cues on Food Packages for Children vs. Adults,"Packaging is increasingly recognized as an essential component of any marketing strategy. Visual and informational front-of-pack cues constitute salient elements of the environment that may influence what and how much someone eats. Considering their overwhelming presence on packaging of non-core foods, front-of-pack cues may contribute to the growing rates of overweight and obesity in children and adults. We conducted a systematic review to summarize the evidence concerning the impact of front-of-pack cues on choices and eating behaviors. Four electronic databases were searched for experimental studies (2009–present). This resulted in the inclusion of 57 studies (in 43 articles). We identified studies on children (3–12 years) and adults (≥ 18 years), but no studies on adolescents (12–18 years). The results suggest that children and adults are susceptible to packaging cues, with most evidence supporting the impact of visual cues. More specifically, children more often choose products with a licensed endorser and eat more from packages portraying the product with an exaggerated portion size. Adults’ eating behaviors are influenced by a range of other visual cues, mainly, package size and shape, and less so by informational cues such as labels.",0

This study aims to address this knowledge gap by reviewing the literature published after 2010. Methods We reviewed literature from databases such as PubMed and Google Scholar using PRISMA guidelines to identify studies that address occupational PTSD and examined the status (prevalence or incidence), the risk factors, and the health effects of PTSD among workers. Results In total, 123 articles were identified, and finally, 31 (25.2%) articles were selected after excluding duplicates. Various occupational traumatic physical events were reported such as natural or manmade disaster, explosion, accident, handling refugee corpses, or bullying at work. Risk of PTSD was closely associated with working conditions, severity of injury, history of mental disorder, occurrence of psychiatric symptoms at the time of the event, personality, interpersonal relationships, etc. Workers with PTSD were likely to experience a deterioration of physical and psychological health and impairment of social and occupational functioning. Conclusions Our review suggests that many workers remain highly vulnerable to occupational PTSD and its consequences.",0

However, illness risk is associated with both the concentration of pathogens in the water and the degree of contact with those pathogens. Different recreational activities can result in different levels of contact with ambient water containing water-borne pathogens. We conducted a systematic literature review and meta-analysis to evaluate risks of illness associated with different recreational activities and different levels of contact to ambient surface waters. We screened 8,618 potentially relevant studies for quantitative measures of risk using inclusion/exclusion criteria established in advance. We categorized recreational activities as swimming, sports-related contact, minimal contact, and sand contact. We combined relative risks using a random effects meta-analysis for adverse health outcome categories representing gastrointestinal illness, respiratory illness, skin, eye, ear, nose, throat, and cold/flu illness. We identified 92 studies meeting our inclusion criteria. Pooled risk estimates indicate significant elevation of gastrointestinal illness with the recreational activity categories swimming (2.19, 95% CI: 1.82, 2.63) and sports-related contact (2.69, 95% CI: 1.04, 6.92), and nonsignificant elevation of gastrointestinal illness with minimal contact (1.27, 95% CI: 0.74, 2.16). We also found a significant elevation of respiratory illness with swimming (1.78, 95% CI: 1.38, 2.29) and sports-related contact (1.49, 95% CI: 1.00, 2.24), and no elevation of respiratory illness with minimal contact (0.90, 95% CI: 0.71, 1.14). This study suggests that exposures associated with different types of recreational activities are important characteristics of the exposure pathway when assessing illness risk associated with recreation in ambient surface waters. • Some water quality guidelines for secondary contact recreation are less stringent. • Lower illness risk pressumed compared to primary contact recreation (swimming). • Meta-analysis shows lower illness risk with lower exposure activities. • Illness risk from high exposure non-swimming activities are similar to swimming. • Activity exposure characteristics are important when assessing illness risk.",1

Emerging evidence demonstrates that children born of pregnancies complicated by GDM may be at increased risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) in adulthood. Therefore, the aim of this study was to determine cardiovascular risk factors in offspring exposed to GDM in utero. PubMed, CINAHL, SCOPUS, and EMBASE databases were searched. Information was extracted on established CVD risk factors including blood pressure, lipids, blood glucose, fasting insulin, body mass index (BMI), and endothelial/microvascular function. The review protocol is registered in PROSPERO (CRD42018094983). Prospective and retrospective studies comparing offspring exposed to GDM compared to controls (non-GDM pregnancies) were considered. We included studies that defined GDM based on the International Association of Diabetes and Pregnancy Study Groups (IADPSG) definition, or prior definitions. The PRISMA guidelines were followed in conducting this systematic review. Methodological quality was assessed using the Newcastle-Ottawa Quality Assessment Scale. Study selection, data extraction, and quality assessment were done by two independent reviewers. The data were pooled using a random-effects model. Of 59 eligible studies, 24 were included in the meta-analysis. Offspring exposed to GDM had higher systolic blood pressure (mean difference (MD): 1.75 mmHg, 95% CI 0.57-2.94; eight studies, 7264 participants), BMI z-score (MD 0.11, 95% CI 0.02-0.20; nine studies, 8759 participants), and glucose (standard MD 0.43, 95% CI 0.08-0.77; 11 studies, 6423 participants) than control participants. In conclusion, offspring exposed to GDM have elevated systolic blood pressure, BMI, and glucose. Those exposed to GDM in utero may benefit from early childhood blood pressure measurements.",0

The aim of this systemic review was to assess these complications in women who had used OCs before pregnancy compared with those in a control group. Materials and Methods: The databases of PubMed, EMBASE, and Web of Science were searched up to December 2018. We included studies where the primary outcome was the risk of PB, LBW, and SAB in women with pregravid OCs use compared with the control group. Odds ratio (OR) value was calculated to assess the risk. Results: Eighteen studies were included in the systematic review, and a total of 148,406 subjects from 7 studies were pooled for the meta-analysis. Results showed that the risk of PB was slightly higher in the exposed group (OR = 1.17, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.07-1.27, p = 0.0005); however, there was a lower risk for SAB compared with the control group (OR = 0.63, 95% CI = 0.41-0.96, p = 0.03). No significant difference was found in the incidence of LBW (OR = 1.36, 95% CI = 0.92-2.02, p = 0.12). Conclusions: This systematic review and meta-analysis demonstrated a higher risk for PB and a lower risk for SAB in women with previous ORs use, whereas no association was found between ORs use and LBW risk.",0
https://doi.org/10.1093/humupd/dmaa002,Early life factors for endometriosis: a systematic review,"Abstract BACKGROUND Despite its high prevalence and health burden, many aspects of endometriosis remain unclear, including risk factors and the underlying biological mechanisms. Exposures during early life, including in utero, are thought to play an important role in the subsequent onset of the condition. To date, however, much of the evidence from studies on early life exposures and diagnosed endometriosis appears mixed and difficult to assess. OBJECTIVE AND RATIONALE This study aims to provide a systematic review of the epidemiologic evidence on early life factors associated with the subsequent diagnosis of endometriosis. In utero and early life exposures have previously been linked to a range of adult health outcomes, including infertility. SEARCH METHODS A systematic review of case–control, cross-sectional and cohort studies was conducted using the search terms ‘endometriosis’[MeSH] AND (‘risk factors’[MeSH] OR ‘protective factors’[MeSH]) AND (‘in utero’, ‘fetal’, ‘neonatal, ‘perinatal’, ‘developmental origins’, ‘early life’, ‘childhood’ OR ‘life course’) in Embase, PubMed and Scopus databases. The review included articles published in English until 10 June 2018 with original data from studies with diagnosed endometriosis. The quality of primary studies was evaluated using the Newcastle–Ottawa Scale by both authors independently. Due to the degree of inconsistency in the measurements and study methods, a qualitative assessment of findings was undertaken rather than meta-analysis. OUTCOMES The search retrieved 70 records without duplicates that contained 20 records on human case–control, cross-sectional or cohort studies, from which 11 papers/studies were selected based on their assessment score. The majority of studies found that women born with low birthweight (&amp;lt;2.5 kg or &amp;lt;5.5 lb) were more likely to be diagnosed with endometriosis. For other early life factors, the evidence is mixed or limited, with further research needed on the association of endometriosis with preterm birth, in utero exposure to diethylstilbestrol and to maternal smoking, passive smoking in early life, and infant formula feeding (compared with breastfeeding). WIDER IMPLICATIONS While the weight of evidence points to low birthweight as a risk factor for diagnosis of endometriosis, future research is warranted on this and other key early life exposures where the findings are mixed to provide more robust evidence and for insights on potential causal pathways. Such research, however, needs to address current methodological issues, such as the use of prospective data from large population-based studies, better diagnostic methods to confirm disease free status, more consistent definitions of variables and consideration of potential biological mechanisms to guide the analyses. The improvements will advance the future synthesis of evidence to support clinically relevant risk assessment for a more timely diagnosis and treatment of endometriosis.",0

The main risk for bioprostheses is structural valve degeneration (SVD); however, little is known about what the most important risk factors are. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to identify the risk factors and estimate their pooled effect sizes to aid the prosthesis choice for replacement. We followed PRISMA guidelines and systematically searched three electronic databases (PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science) using appropriate key terms: 'aortic valve', 'bioprosthesis', 'degeneration', 'durability', 'prosthesis failure', etc. Hazard ratio (HR) and odds ratio (OR) and associated 95% confidence intervals (CI) were extracted. Pooled risk estimates were calculated using a random-effects model. Twenty-nine (29) observational studies were included with a total of 25,490 patients, 981 of whom developed SVD over a mean follow-up time of 18.5 years. Four (4) factors influencing bioprosthetic SVD were identified: increasing age was a protective factor (per 1-yr increase, HR: 0.91 [95% CI 0.89, 0.94], p<0.0001), whereas increased body surface area (HR 1.77 [1.04, 3.01], p=0.034), patient-prosthesis mismatch (HR 1.95 [1.56, 2.43], p<0.001), and smoking (HR 2.28 [1.37, 3.79], p=0.0015) were risk factors for SVD. We found younger age, patient-prosthesis mismatch, body surface area, and smoking, as risk factors for aortic SVD, which should be considered for valve selection. This study generates a further hypothesis that accelerated flow across the valve is a shared key component in the pathophysiology of SVD, thus future research should consider other high cardiac output states.",0
https://doi.org/10.1016/j.pnpbp.2020.109938,Noninvasive brain stimulation in alcohol craving: A systematic review and meta-analysis,"Alcohol dependence (AD) is characterized by a set of physical and behavioral symptoms, which may include withdrawal, tolerance and craving. Recently, noninvasive brain stimulation (NIBS) methods, namely transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) and transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), have been investigated as possible new therapeutic approaches for adjusting the pathological neuroplasticity involved in alcohol dependence. Therefore, we conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis on the therapeutic uses of tDCS and rTMS in AD patients. A systematic search was performed on Scopus, Web of Science, PubMed, Cochrane library and ProQuest. Search terms presented the diagnoses of interest (alcohol dependence, alcohol craving, alcohol use disorders and hazardous drinkers) and the intervention of interest (NIBS, TMS, rTMS, TBS, tDCS, tACS and transcranial). Original articles reporting the use of tDCS or rTMS to treat AD were screened and studied by two researchers independently based on PRISMA guidelines. Next, in the meta-analysis step, random-effects model was utilized to measure the pooled effect size. We found 34 eligible studies including 11 tDCS trials and 23 rTMS trials. Three of these studies were case-reports, four were open label trials and the remaining 27 were controlled trials which assessed tDCS/rTMS effects on the three cognitive, behavioral and biological dimensions in AD. The pooled standardized mean differences for the effects of tDCS and rTMS on alcohol cravings were − 0.13 [−0.34, 0.08] and − 0.43 [−1.02, 0.17], respectively. There is no evidence for a positive effect of tDCS/rTMS on various dimensions of AD. We need more randomized, double blind, sham controlled trials with enough follow-up periods to evaluate the efficacy of tDCS/rTMS for alcohol dependence treatment. • tDCS/rTMS may provide new approachs to better examine and treat alcohol craving. • Most tDCS/rTMS protocols have targeted prefrontal cortex to improve craving symptom. • There is no evidence for a positive effect of tDCS/rTMS on various dimensions of AD.",0

Hence, in this study, we did a meta-analysis to explore the correlation between overexpression of these markers and some clinicopathological features and their influence on the survival of esophageal cancer patients.&#x0D; A search in PubMed and Web of Science (among all articles published up to January 16, 2018) was done using the following keywords: esophageal cancer, CD44, CD133, prominin-1, AC133. Suitable studies, that were selected based on the criteria listed in the Materials and Methods section, were chosen and hazard ratios with 95% conﬁdence intervals were estimated if available. Heterogeneity and sensitivity were also analyzed. Furthermore, publication bias was assessed using funnel plots, Egger, and Begg tests.&#x0D; The study included 1346 patients from 13 related studies. The median rates of marker expressions by immunohistochemistry were 35.7% (30%-76.6%) from 9 studies for CD44 and 31.9% (21%–44.2%) from 5 studies for CD133. The accumulative 5-year overall survival rates of CD44-positive and CD133-positive were 1.59% (1.22-2.06) and 1.27% (0.93-1.73), respectively. Meta-analysis showed that CD44 expression had a significant correlation with 5-year overall survival.&#x0D; CD44 overexpression showed a correlation with some clinicopathological features such as lymph node metastasis, vascular invasion, and recurrence of the disease, while it was not the case for coexpression of CD44 and CD133. In conclusion, CD44 overexpression was associated with a 5-year overall survival rate and thus this biomarker can be a suitable prognostic tool in esophageal cancer.",0

However, season might be an important factor contributing to adverse health effects of air pollution. Given the current inconsistencies in results of previous studies on the effect modification of air pollution on morbidity by season, a systematic review and meta-analysis was conducted to synthesize the current evidence on effects of season on air pollution and morbidity. The electronic databases including PubMed, Web of Science, Embase, CNKI, and Wanfang were used to identify papers published up to the 30st of November in 2019. We identified 4284 articles, after screening, eighty papers met the inclusion criteria. Significant effect modification of CO, O3, SO2 and NO2 on morbidity by season was observed, with corresponding ratio of relative risk of 1.0009 (95% CI: 1.0001-1.0018), 1.0080 (95% CI: 1.0021-1.0138), 0.9828 (95% CI: 0.9697-0.9962) and 0.9896 (95% CI: 0.9824-0.9968), respectively. Season significantly modified the effect of CO on pneumonia, the effect of SO2 on cardiovascular disease, the effect of PM10 on stroke, and the effect of O3 on stroke, asthma and pneumonia. The effect modifications of air pollution by season were similar among males and females, while the effect estimates seem to be higher among children under 18 years old and the elderly aged 75 or over. Further research is needed to better understand the mechanisms underlying the seasonal variance of the effect of air pollutants on morbidity.",1

In total, 25 951 deaths were recorded during 5.5-35 year follow-ups. Our meta-analysis showed that running participation is associated with 27%, 30% and 23% lower risk of all-cause (pooled adjusted hazard ratio (HR)=0.73; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.68 to 0.79), cardiovascular (HR=0.70; 95% CI 0.49 to 0.98) and cancer (HR=0.77; 95% CI 0.68 to 0.87) mortality, respectively, compared with no running. A meta-regression analysis showed no significant dose-response trends for weekly frequency, weekly duration, pace and the total volume of running.Increased rates of participation in running, regardless of its dose, would probably lead to substantial improvements in population health and longevity. Any amount of running, even just once a week, is better than no running, but higher doses of running may not necessarily be associated with greater mortality benefits.",0

Electronic databases (PubMed [MEDLINE], Cochrane Library, EMBASE) were searched for corresponding references up to 31 May 2019. Possible outcomes were pulp exposure, pulpo-periodontal complications, or restorative failures. Three reviewers independently selected studies, extracted data, and assessed the risk of bias using RoB 2. Meta-analyses for intention-to-treat and per-protocol scenarios were performed using Revman5. Of 1374 potentially eligible articles, ten relevant references corresponding to eight studies were included. Pooled results showed decreased risk of pulp exposure after SCR (OR: 0.10, 95% CI [0.04, 0.25]) or SWR (OR: 0.20, 95% CI [0.09, 0.44]), compared with CCR. There was a higher risk of composite restorative failure (OR: 2.61, 95% CI [1.05, 6.49]) using USPHS criteria, after SCR compared with CCR only in intention-to-treat analysis. Risk of clinical or radiographic failure of pulpo-periodontal complications was unchanged when compared with SCR and CCR or SWR. SCR and SWR may result in lower pulp exposure risk than CCR. RCTs with lower risk of bias, higher power, and longer follow-up are required to choose between these three caries removal techniques for deep carious lesions in vital temporary teeth.",0

Key risk factors for recurrent falls in community-dwelling older adults are not well established due to methodological limitations, such as recall bias. A better understanding of the risk factors for recurrent falls will aid in refining clinical practice guidelines for secondary fall prevention strategies. The primary objective of this systematic review with meta-analysis is to examine the risk factors for recurrent falls in prospective studies among community-dwelling older adults. Methods and analysis A comprehensive search for articles indexed in MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO and CINAHL databases as well as grey literature was conducted on April 25, 2019. We will use MeSH and keyword search terms around the following topics: falls, recurrence, fall-risk, ageing and prospective studies. Prospective studies with monthly falls monitoring for 12 months, investigating risk factors for recurrent falls in older adults will be included. One author will complete the search. Two authors will remove duplicates and screen the titles and abstracts for their potential inclusion against the eligibility criteria. Two authors will screen the full texts and extract the data using a piloted extraction sheet. Included studies will be evaluated for the risk of bias with the Joanna Briggs Institute Prevalence Critical Appraisal tools. The quality of reporting will be determined with the Strengthening the Reporting of OBservational studies in Epidemiology. The data extraction will include study characteristics as well as sociodemographic, balance and mobility, sensory and neuromuscular, psychological, medical, medication and environmental factors. The results will be presented via figures, summary tables, meta-analysis (when possible) and narrative summaries. Ethics and dissemination No ethics approval will be required. Findings will be disseminated through publication and media. PROSPERO registration number CRD42019118888; Pre-results.",0
https://doi.org/10.1093/advances/nmz122,Food Insecurity and Cognitive Function in Middle to Older Adulthood: A Systematic Review,"Food insecurity (FI) may limit cognitive functioning during aging. The goal of this systematic review was to summarize existing evidence linking FI and general or specific cognitive functions in middle and older adulthood. A systematic search of human studies published between 1 January 2000 and 30 April 2018 was conducted in PubMed, PsycINFO, and CAB Direct. Four independent reviewers assessed the eligibility of identified articles and conducted data extraction and data quality assessment. Ten studies were included in the review, including 1 cluster-randomized controlled trial, 2 longitudinal studies, and 7 cross-sectional studies. Three studies reported the association between early-life FI experience and a global cognitive function measure. Nine studies reported later-life FI experience in relation to global or specific cognitive functions. The results suggest an adverse association between FI experienced in early or later life and global cognitive function; and between later-life FI and executive function and memory. Findings from the review are preliminary because of sparse data, heterogeneity across study populations, exposure and outcome assessments, and potential risk of bias across studies. Future studies are recommended to better understand the role of FI in cognitive function, with the goal of identifying possible critical windows for correction of FI in vulnerable subpopulations to prevent neurocognitive deficit in adulthood.",1
https://doi.org/10.1127/anthranz/2020/1223,Plasticity of human growth – a systematic review on psychosocial factors influencing growth,"Background: This systematic review aimed at collecting, analyzing and summarizing scientific studies focusing on psychosocial factors that influence linear growth among humans. Methods: The online database ""PubMed"" was used in order to acquire suitable scientific studies. These studies were evaluated based on clearly defined criteria that determine whether a study was to be excluded or included in the literature review. In the end, a total sum of 36 studies remained, which were carefully analyzed and used to generate an overview of the association between psychosocial factors and linear growth. Results: In the 36 reviewed studies, different social and psychological factors, such as socioeconomic status, parental education or emotional deprivation were set in relation to physical growth among humans. The studies were listed and summarized, depending on the investigated psychosocial factor. A clear association between psychosocial factors and growth could be observed in most of the reviewed studies. Discussion: Based on the results of the reviewed studies it could be concluded that the regulation of linear growth is also subject to different psychosocial factors. The way in which the developing human and the specific social environment interact seemed to have a major impact on linear growth. Status-specific stress was discussed as one possible explanation for the regulating mechanism of human linear growth.",0

The evidence base underlying these concerns relies in part on case reports. This systematic review assesses these case reports for their reliability to inform this debate. Method Study selection was restricted to case reports describing possible pyrrolizidine alkaloid related harm and ingestion of comfrey, coltsfoot or borage. An extensive search of academic databases was conducted. Papers meeting the criteria were critically appraised. Results The search resulted in 11 appropriate case reports, none of which involved borage. Nine reports were assessed for causality and indicated some degree of association between the material ingested and the adverse event. Lack of unequivocal identification of the species ingested compromised attribution and was a significant source of uncertainty. Three levels of identity confusions were found; misidentification or substitution at the level of the whole herb; omission of appropriate botanical identification and attribution of a specific PA to either comfrey or coltsfoot when it is a constituent found in other plants of established toxicity. Conclusion These cases are an unreliable body of evidence on which to draw conclusions about the safety of the oral consumption of Symphytum officinale and Tussilago farfara. Toxicological studies based on oral ingestion of phytochemically-complex preparations of these herbs may be the most accurate methodology for assessing clinical risk.",0

Predictive factors of therapy efficacy are lacking.We included articles reporting data about randomized-controlled clinical trials (RCTs) testing an ARAT agent plus ADT vs. ADT. We aimed to obtain pooled estimates of efficacy outcomes and assess differences in pooled estimates of efficacy outcomes between sub-groups.A total of 5427 mCSPC patients enrolled in five RCTs were evaluable for OS (Overall Survival) and PFS (Progression-free survival). Pooled OS-HR (Hazard Ratio) was 0.66 (95 % CI: 0.60-0.74), while pooled PFS-HR was 0.46 (95 % CI: 0.40-0.53). Combined treatment with docetaxel was associated with differential OS outcomes, while tumor volume according to the CHAARTED criteria and visceral metastasis were associated with differential PFS outcomes.Our results add evidence that ARAT agents improve OS in mCSPC and discourage their combined use with docetaxel in this setting.",0

The aim of this systematic review is to identify types of occupational ocular injuries and examine factors associated with these injuries. Methods Four health sciences databases (Ovid Medline, Embase, PsycINFO, and CINAHL) were reviewed to identify evidence pertaining to occupational ocular injuries. This systematic review was registered with PROSPERO (registration number: CRD42018089876) and followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA). The PICO (Population/Intervention/Comparison/Outcome) tool was used to support, structure, and improve our search strategy. Results Overall, 12 studies with quantitative Critical Appraisal Skills Programme grading scores were assessed in a systematic review and meta-analysis of ocular injuries in the workplace. The systematic review identified four main factors associated with occupational ocular injury: (a) use of eye protection at the time of the ocular injury, (b) being male, (c) exposure to biological or chemical occupational hazards, and (d) risk-taking behavior. Conclusions Differences in risk between countries of origin, occupational sectors, and dates of publication, suggest likely differences or changes in safety procedures. We recommend that employers ensure that safety equipment is tailored to the protection of their specific occupational hazards, and that employees are adhering to safety protocols.",0

We aimed to systematically characterize HLH in moderate-to-severe inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). We performed a systematic review of the literature (PubMED; EMBASE) and FDA Adverse Event Reporting System in accordance with the PRISMA statement. Use of biologics was used as a surrogate definition for disease severity (consistent with usual and contemporary clinical management), to enable identification of rare HLH cases with the highest fidelity. 58 cases of HLH occurring in IBD patients are known (mean age: 26.0 years, 70% male, 83% with Crohn’s disease, mean disease duration 7.0 years). 34.5% of patients were undergoing induction therapy at HLH diagnosis. All cases occurred on patients exposed to anti-TNF agents, but cases with anti-integrin or anti-IL-12/23 exposure were reported. 2/3 of cases did not report prior AZA/6MP exposure. Underlying opportunistic infection or lymphoma was found in > 80% of cases. Survival was 70% if promptly recognized and treated. Five patients restarted biologics after HLH resolved, and one patient developed recurrent HLH. HLH is rare among IBD patients exposed to biologic therapy. Most cases had an identifiable infection or malignancy at the time of diagnosis as well as history of immunomodulator use. Risk factors may include younger age, male gender, presence of Crohn’s disease, and induction phase of treatment. Our study is not intended to assess risk of HLH with specific IBD therapies.",0

Methods The guidelines on Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses were followed. Medline, Cinahl, Web of Science and PsycInfo were searched for population: human service workers; exposure: workplace violence; and study type: prospective or longitudinal in articles published 1990–August 2019. Quality assessment was performed based on a modified version of the Cochrane’s ‘Tool to Assess Risk of Bias in Cohort Studies’. Results After deduplication, 3566 studies remained, of which 132 articles were selected for full-text screening and 28 were included in the systematic review. A majority of the studies focused on healthcare personnel, were from the Nordic countries and were assessed to have medium quality. Nine of 11 associations between physical violence and poor mental health were statistically significant, and 3 of 4 associations between physical violence and sickness absence. Ten of 13 associations between psychological violence and poor mental health were statistically significant and 6 of 6 associations between psychological violence and sickness absence. The only study on gender-based violence and health reported a statistically non-significant association. Conclusion There is consistent evidence mainly in medium quality studies of prospective associations between psychological violence and poor mental health and sickness absence, and between physical violence and poor mental health in human service workers. More research using objective outcomes, improved exposure assessment and that focus on gender-based violence is needed.",0

Method A PubMed search was performed to identify cohort studies about cancer risk and firefighting presented with standardized incidence ratios (SIRs) or standardized mortality ratios (SMRs). Using random-effect models, meta-relative risk estimates (mSIRs, mSMRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were assessed. Cohort studies with employment starting before 1950 were classified as “old”, studies starting between 1950 and 1970 as “medium”, and later studies as “new”. Results The general cancer risk of firefighters was similar to the general population, but mSMR decreased over time (new studies: mSMR = 0.81, 95% CI 0.70–0.92). We observed an increase of mSIR for melanoma of the skin and prostate cancer as well as a decrease of mSIR for stomach cancer with later employment onset. For those cancer sites, we did not observe a secular trend of mSMRs. Regional differences between relative cancer risks were particularly observed for bladder cancer. Conclusions Among other things, innovative firefighting techniques and better personal protective equipment have provided a safer and healthier working environment for firefighters over time leading to a reduction of overall cancer incidence and mortality ratios. Increased general preventive medical checkups and possible additional screenings for firefighters might have led to more findings of malignant melanoma of the skin and prostate cancer in the recent past.",0

In this review we focus on the effect of prenatal and intrapartum maternally administered antibiotics on the infant intestinal microbiota. Methods A systematic literature search was conducted in PubMed and EMBASE. All studies reporting effect on diversity or microbiota profiles were included. Results A total of 4.030 records were encountered. A total of 24 articles were included in the final analysis. Infants from mothers exposed to antibiotics during delivery showed a decreased microbial diversity compared to non-exposed infants. The microbiota of infants exposed to antibiotics was characterised by a decreased abundance of Bacteriodetes and Bifidobacteria, with a concurrent increase of Proteobacteria. These effects were most pronounced in term vaginally born infants. Conclusion Maternal administration of antibiotics seems to have profound effects on the infant gut microbiota colonisation. Interpretation of microbiota aberrations in specific populations, such as preterm and caesarean born infants, is complicated by multiple confounding factors and by lack of high quality studies and high heterogeneity in study design. Further research is needed to investigate the potential short- and long-term clinical consequences of these microbial alterations.",0

Methods A systematic search of databases Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature, Medline, Embase, and the Cochrane library was carried out. Specific inclusion and exclusion criteria were adhered to, with no publication date limitations added. The chosen studies were examined for quality, data were extracted and analysed, before a narrative synthesis was performed. The last search occurred on January 7, 2019, with PRISMA flow diagrams completed for identified studies. Results Ten studies of varying methodology design were included in this review. Variations of thermoregulation interventions were included in the 10 studies. Nevertheless, all of them demonstrated that admission temperature rates can be significantly improved by implementing a thermoregulation QI. The multidisciplinary team and ongoing education were seen as much needed components to the overall sustainability, and continuing success of the QI's. Practical implications This systematic review determines that thermoregulation QIs can positively impact the admission temperatures of premature/very-low-birth-weight infants in the NICU. Prevention of hypothermia is aimed at reducing the risks of developing major neonatal morbidities. The pooling of the results from the 10 studies helps in the sharing of outcome measures and thus, improving quantitative synthesis. More frequent monitoring of the axillary temperature would help in preventing hypothermia and hyperthermia occurring. Ongoing education and staff training are essential for managing thermoregulation successfully. Examining the compliance rates to such quality initiatives, and the variations in interventions would benefit from further research to ensure better standardisation of clinical practice.",0

A systematic review and meta-analysis was performed. Eligible studies were retrieved from PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library and Web of Science databases up to October 2019. The endpoints included overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS). Multivariable adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were used to evaluate each endpoint. Thirty observational studies of low to moderate risk of bias embracing 6754 patients with mRCC were included. The results showed that patients with a high pretreatment serum LDH had an inferior OS (HR: 2.15, 95% CI: 1.85–2.51; P < 0.001) and PFS (HR: 1.76, 95% CI: 1.49–2.10; P < 0.001). Subgroup analyses according to year of publication, study design, patient population, geographic region, sample size and NOS score did not alter the direction of results. There was significant publication bias for OS, but not for PFS. Sensitivity analyses further confirmed the robustness of the results. Our findings indicated that a high level of pretreatment serum LDH was associated with an inferior OS and DFS in patients with mRCC. Methodological limitations should be considered while interpreting these results. • There are uncertainties over the prognostic role of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) in metastatic renal cell carcinoma (mRCC). • Elevated LDH was associated with poor overall survival and progression-free survival in patients with mRCC. • Pretreatment LDH can be important factor incorporated into the prognostic models for mRCC.",0

We aimed to explore this clinical issue through a systematic review and meta-analysis. PubMed, EMBASE and the Cochrane Library were searched, and data were expressed as mean difference (MD) or hazard ratio (HR)/odds ratio (OR) with a 95% confidence interval (CI). Heterogeneity was assessed using the Chi-squared test and the I2 statistic. The study was registered with PROSPERO (ID: CRD42019138777). Eleven studies (n = 304,258 T2DM patients) were included in our review. In the DPP-4I group, six studies were enrolled to estimate ΔMini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) scores from baseline to the final evaluations after DPP-4I treatment, which showed no statistical difference (MD 0.20; 95% CI − 0.75 to 1.15, p = 0.68). ΔMMSE scores in the DPP-4I group and the other antidiabetic groups were compared, revealing no statistical difference (MD 0.57; 95% CI − 0.05 to 1.19, p = 0.07). Two cohort studies were pooled to determine the HRs for dementia, showing a lower risk of dementia after DPP-4I treatment (HR 0.52; 95% CI 0.29–0.93, p = 0.03). In the GLP-1 analogs group, two studies were included, one of which revealed a downward trend in the risk of dementia after GLP-1 analog treatment, while the other revealed no significant difference after incretins treatment. Currently there is not enough irrefutable evidence to support the hypothesis of positive effects of incretins on cognition. Further clinical studies need to be performed.",0

This study aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of adjuvant transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) after curative hepatectomy for HCC with MVI. Methods An online search on Embase and Ovid MEDLINE(R) was conducted to identify the appropriate articles published prior to March 11, 2019. The primary endpoint was the overall survival (OS) of patients treated using adjuvant TACE after hepatectomy (HTAT) versus hepatectomy (HT) alone for HCC with MVI. The secondary endpoints were disease-free survival (DFS) and safety. Results Seven studies with 1869 patients were included in this analysis. Meta-analyses demonstrated that HTAT was superior to HT in OS (Hazard Ratio [HR]: 0.67, 95%CI: 0.58–0.77, P  Conclusions Adjuvant TACE after hepatectomy is effective and safe for patients with HCC accompanied by MVI.

Previous studies have reached mixed conclusions regarding the effect of vitamin C on reducing CRP or hs-CRP level. The present systematic review and meta-analysis was conducted to resolve these inconsistencies. Materials and methods: Related articles published up to August 2018 were searched through PubMed, Scopus, Ovid, ISI web of science, Embase, and Cochrane databases by relevant keywords. Clinical trials which examined the effect of either vitamin C supplementation or vitamin C-enriched foods on CRP and hs-CRP levels were included. A total of 11 studies with 14 data sets involving 818 subjects were included. Results Overall, the pooled analysis revealed that vitamin C could decrease CRP level relative to placebo group (Weighted mean difference [WMD]=−0.73 mg/L: 95% CI: −1.30 to −0.15, p=0.013) with a considerable heterogeneity (I 2 =98%, p&lt;0.001). Moreover, subgroup analyses revealed that the beneficial effect of vitamin C on CRP level alternation only was found in male (p=0.003), non-smoker (p=0.041), healthy (p=0.029) and younger participants (p=0.010). Vitamin C could improve CRP level only at doses of less than 500 mg/day (p=0.009). Regarding hs-CRP changes, the pooled analysis did not show any significant effect of vitamin C (WMD=−0.65 mg/L: 95% CI: −2.03 to 0.72, p=0.35). This finding was confirmed by all subgroup analyses expect for high quality articles in which hs-CRP level was elevated after vitamin C supplementation (p=0.026). Conclusion In conclusion, supplementation with vitamin C might have a significant effect only on CRP reduction. Further studies are needed to confirm this effect.",0

Various factors have been found to be associated with burnout, and it has significant consequences personally and systemically. Junior doctors are increasingly placing their own health and wellbeing as the most important factor in their decisions about training. Finding ways to reduce and prevent burnout is imperative to promote surgical specialties as attractive training pathways. Methods The MEDLINE, PsychInfo and EMBASE databases were searched using the subject headings related to surgery and burnout. All full text articles that reported data related to burnout were eligible for inclusion. Articles which did not use the Maslach Burnout Inventory or included non-surgical groups were excluded; 62 articles fulfilled the criteria for inclusion. Findings Younger age and female sex tended to be associated with higher levels of burnout. Those further in training had lower levels of burnout, while residents suffered more than their seniors. Burnout is associated with a lower personal quality of life, depression and alcohol misuse. Academic work and emotional intelligence may be protective of burnout. Certain personality types are less likely to be burnt out. Mentorship may reduce levels of burnout. Conclusions Workload and work environment are areas that could be looked at to reduce job demands that lead to burnout. Intervening in certain psychological factors such as emotional intelligence, resilience and mindfulness may help to reduce burnout. Promoting physical and mental health is important in alleviating burnout, and these factors likely have a complex interplay.",0

We conducted a systematic review comparing change in Sk, CKD progression, and mortality between those on a low-potassium versus unrestricted potassium diet.We searched Medline, AMED, PsycINFO, CINAHL, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and Clinicaltrials.org from inception to 3 April 2018. We included randomized and observational studies that compared these outcomes in adults with CKD who ate a restricted versus unrestricted amount of dietary potassium. We pooled mean change in Sk and adjusted hazard ratios of disease progression and mortality using random-effects meta-analyses.We identified 5,563 articles, of which seven studies (3,489 participants) met our inclusion criteria. We found very low-quality evidence that restricted (1,295 mg/d) versus unrestricted (1,570 mg/d) dietary potassium lowered Sk by -0.22 mEq/L (95% confidence interval [CI]: -0.33, -0.10; I2 = 0%). Lower (1,725 mg/d) versus higher (4,558 mg/d) dietary potassium was not significantly associated with disease progression (hazard ratio [HR]: 1.14; 95% CI: 0.77, 1.70; I2 = 57%). Lower (1,670 mg/d), compared with higher (4,414 mg/d) dietary potassium intake was associated with a 40% reduction in mortality hazard (HR: 0.60; 95% CI: 0.40, 0.89; I2 = 56%).Very-low-quality evidence supports consensus that dietary potassium restriction reduces Sk in normokalemia and is associated with a reduced risk of death in those with CKD.

One independent reviewer (MAA) verified that the studies met the inclusion criteria, and three independent reviewers (MAA, AHM, CMA) assessed the quality of the studies and extracted their relevant characteristics. All the studies were assessed for quality using the JBI assessment and were assessed for risk of bias according to the Hoy et al. approach. Results The initial search identified 158 papers; five studies met the inclusion criteria. The nature of the findings meant no meta-analysis could be performed; therefore, a narrative summary was generated to discuss the findings. The prevalence of LBP in different professional groups within a working-age group ranged between 64% and 89%. Discussion The prevalence of LBP in the KSA has only been examined within specific professional groups, which limits the ability to generalize the finding. The review clarifies the need for further quality epidemiological studies to identify the prevalence of LBP in the general population. Many of the issues identified are problems related to occupational risk of LBP. The implication therefore is that these occupational factors need to be assessed so that risk factors for LBP among employees in KSA can be modified. 1 The prevalence of LBP in the KSA has only been examined within specific professional groups. 2 The included studies link the prevalence of LBP to numbers of occupational-risk factors such as; participants' specialities, years of experience and working load. 3 The prevalence of LBP is more common in female employee. 4 This review outlines the need for further epidemiology studies of the general population in the KSA.",0

We planned a systematic review and meta-analysis of cardiovascular outcome trials (CVOTs) that evaluated the effect of gliflozins on MACE risk in patients with T2D stratified by age and by statin use.The electronic search was carried out until 20 January 2020. RCTs were included if they were CVOTs performed in adults with T2D, compared add-on therapy with any gliflozin versus placebo, and had major cardiovascular events (MACE) as primary outcome. We limited the evaluation to MACE in order to minimize the statistical impact of post-hoc analyses. We used a random-effect model to calculate hazard ratio (HR) and 95% CI.The hazard ratio for MACE was 0.95 (95% CI, 0.86-1.05) in people <65 years and 0.83 (95% CI, 0.71-0.96) for people ≥65 years, with no subgroup differences (P-value = 0.15), suggesting that the effect was consistent across age categories. The hazard ratio for MACE was 0.87 (95% CI, 0.81-0.94) in people taking a statin and 0.88 (95% CI, 0.77-1.01) for people not taking statin, with no subgroup differences (P-value = 0.90).The results are reassuring, as they confirm that the efficacy profile of gliflozins is unchanged by age, and may further enhance the CV protection offered by statin.",0
https://doi.org/10.1111/myc.13094,<i>Kodamaea ohmeri</i> infections in humans: A systematic review,"Background Kodamaea ohmeri, previously known as Pichia ohmeri or Yamadazyma ohmeri, belongs to the Saccharomycetaceae family and the Ascomycetae class, is the telomorphic form of C guilliermondii var. membranaefaciens and is frequently mistaken for Candida, as they belong to the same family. It has been isolated from environmental sources, such as sand, pools, seawater and fruits, while the last decades it is recognised as a rare pathogen that causes life-threatening infections in humans. The purpose of this study was to systemically review all published cases of K ohmeri infections in the literature and describe the epidemiology, microbiology, antimicrobial susceptibility, treatment and outcomes of these infections in humans. Methods Systematic review of PubMed (through 27th December 2019) for studies providing epidemiological, clinical, microbiological as well as treatment data and outcomes of K ohmeri infections. Results A total of 35 studies, containing data of 44 patients, were included in the analysis. The most common K ohmeri infections were those of the bloodstream, infective endocarditis and onychomycosis. Previous antibiotic use, presence of a central venous catheter, parenteral nutrition and cancer were very common among patients. Mortality was high in the case of fungemias but low for other types of infections. Amphotericin B and fluconazole are the most common agents used for treatment, even though alarming MICs for fluconazole were noted. Conclusions This systematic review thoroughly describes infections by K ohmeri and provides information on their epidemiology, clinical presentation, microbiology, antibiotic resistance patterns, treatment and outcomes.",0

Both sodium-glucose co-transport-2 inhibitors (SGLT-2Is) and glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1RAs) have shown a significant reduction in CV end-points in CV outcome trials (CVOTs). Whether similar CV benefit exists in Asians, is not yet clearly known. We systematically searched relevant medical database up to January 31, 2020 and retrieved all the dedicated CVOTs conducted with SGLT-2Is and GLP-1RAs. Subsequently, we meta-analyzed the pooled data of hazard ratio (HR) of major adverse cardiac events (MACE) in Asians. We additionally analyzed the data of heart failure hospitalization (HHF) or CV-death with SGLT-2Is in Asians. The meta-analysis of three CVOTs conducted with SGLT-2Is (N = 4987), did not find any significant reduction in MACE (HR, 0.88; 95% CI, 0.67 to 1.15; P = 0.35) and HHF or CV-death (HR, 0.86; 95% CI, 0.55 to 1.36; P = 0.53) in Asians, compared to the placebo. In contrast, the meta-analysis of seven CVOTs conducted with GLP-1RAs (N = 4298) demonstrated a significant reduction in MACE, compared to the placebo (HR, 0.71; 95% CI, 0.59 to 0.86; P < 0.0001). This meta-analysis found a significant reduction in MACE with GLP-1RAs but not with SGLT-2Is in Asians. No significant reduction in HHF or CV-death demonstrated either with SGLT-2Is in Asians. Whether these results are related to an inadequate statistical power, or due to underrepresentation of Asians, or a true ethnic difference, remains to be established. • Current guidelines have proposed an early use of SGLT-2 inhibitors (SGLT-2Is) or GLP-1 receptor agonist (GLP-1RAs) in subjects with type 2 diabetes with high CV risk, however, it is not yet clearly known whether this benefit extends equally to the Asians. • Since Asians in particular South Asians, deveopes type 2 diabetes and its complications early and have high cardiovascular burden, it is necessary to find an effective tools. • In this meta-analysis we have shown that reduction in major cardiovascular events is only significant with GLP-1RAs, but not with SGLT-2Is in Asians.",0

A systematic review of the issue,"More than 110 years has passed since the first publications on Chagas disease, and it still urges the necessity of understanding it as a complex socioenvironmental issue in which components of diverse nature converge and interact beyond the biomedical and epidemiological aspects. The current scenarios of the issue, both rural and Latin American as urban and global, demand that the education on Chagas disease include all possible contexts: where there are insect vectors and where there are not; inside and outside Latin America; in rural, periurban, and urban areas; in formal and non-formal educational environments. We consider essential the requirement of both an integral approach that overcomes the biomedical aspect to include the multidimensionality of the issue and a dialogical educational perspective that allows individuals and communities to analyze, decide, and lead contextualized prevention and promotion actions regarding their health. In this study, we surveyed, described, and critically analyzed studies approaching the link education-Chagas disease in scientific publications from the last 15 years. We aimed at contributing methodological-theoretical elements to (re)think the development of educational research and experiences that truly help facing this issue. From the electronic search of scientific literature in 6 databases, we found 426 articles, out of which we selected 25. We incorporated 10 articles from other sources to this initial corpus and performed both qualitative and quantitative analyses over the total number [35] to characterize the studied works in general, focusing on the conceptions on the Chagas disease issue and the underlying health education approaches. • The field of interest is still incipient. • There is supremacy of the biomedical aspects over other dimensions of the issue. • The development of qualitative approximations is not substantive yet. • There are little participative proposals that promote social transformation.",0

Twenty-nine analysed undifferentiated IPV (n = 25 489), 34 included physical IPV (n = 7333), 22 analysed psychological IPV (n = 7833) and 18 examined sexual IPV (n = 2388). Fifteen studies were from Asia, 12 from North America and Oceania, and 12 from Central and South America. The studies examined the association between IPV and 39 different perinatal health outcomes. The most frequent outcomes reported were pre-term birth (50%), low birthweight (46%), miscarriage (30%), perinatal death (20%) and premature rupture of membranes (20%). A significant association with perinatal health outcomes was reported by 12 of the studies analysing undifferentiated IPV, 18 physical IPV, six psychological IPV and two sexual IPV.The relation between IPV and perinatal health outcomes can be seen in different epidemiological designs and countries. In all, 39 different outcomes were identified and 29 were associated with IPV.A variety of poor perinatal health outcomes are associated with psychological, physical and sexual IPV.",0

A systematic literature search using the PubMed database from January 1, 2000 to December 30th, 2019 was conducted. The effect of RDDs on inter- and intra-fractional prostate displacements was extracted. From 356 articles identified via the PubMed database and hand search, 21 articles were included in the systematic review. There was no randomized study. Twelve studies evaluated the role of the endorectal balloon (ERB) in managing prostate motion. Four studies reported the effect of hydrogel spacer on prostate motion. Four studies examined the effect of the rectal retractor (RR) on intra-fractional prostate motion, and only one study assessed the impact of ProSpare (Nottinghamshire, UK) in reducing prostate motion. Using an ERB significantly reduces intra-fractional prostate motion. This prostate-stabilizing effect of the ERB can translate into reduced planning target volume (PTV) margins and additional rectal dose sparing. Even with an ERB in place, inter-fractional prostate displacements are seen. As a consequence, ERB application does not obviate daily verification; however, this is not a crucial topic because pretreatment imaging is always done nowadays. As compared with ERB, the hydrogel spacer significantly reduces rectal dose and toxicity without influencing prostate immobilization. The RR can increase prostate and rectal inter- and intra-fractional stability without a clear influence on the reduction of rectal toxicity. Finally, it is unclear whether ProSpare is a suitable device reducing prostate motion. Further study will be required to clarify whether the prostate-stabilizing effects of the ERB and RR can result in a safe reduction of PTV margins and further sparing of organs at risks, especially the rectum.",0

Studies meeting the following criteria were included in the analysis: peer-reviewed statistical studies or reports detailing management of potential traumatic spinal injury in RSE, civilian, and military environments; as well as consensus clinical guidelines, academic center, or professional association protocols or policy statements detailing management of potential traumatic spinal injury in RSE, civilian, and military environments; statistical analysis; and subsequent management of spinal injuries after mass-casualty incidents, in complex humanitarian events or conflict zones, low-to middle-income countries, or prolonged transport times published by government and non-government organizations. Studies excluded from consideration were those not related to a patient with a potential traumatic spinal injury after a mass-casualty incident, in complex humanitarian event or conflict zones, in low-to middle-income countries, or with prolonged transport times. There were one thousand twenty-nine (1029) studies initially identified. After removal of duplicates, nine hundred-nineteen (919) were screened with eight hundred sixty-three (863) excluded. The remaining fifty-six (56) received further review with fourteen (14) selected studies achieving inclusion. The reviewed articles comprised six (6) types of studies and represented research from institutions in seven (7) different countries (Israel, United States, Haiti, Wales, Pakistan, China, and Iran). Thirteen (13) references were case reports/narrative reviews, policy statements, retrospective observational studies, narrative literature reviews, scoping reviews, and one systematic review. The majority of literature describing spinal cord injury was predominantly associated with earthquakes and blast-related disasters. There were no SI evidence-based clinical guidelines (EBG) in RSE. Information was obtained that could be used to formulate statements in a modified Delphi study to present to experts to obtain consensus SI EBG in RSE.",0
https://doi.org/10.1002/cpt.1811,The Effects of Cruciferous Vegetable‐Enriched Diets on Drug Metabolism: A Systematic Review and Meta‐Analysis of Dietary Intervention Trials in Humans,"Relatively few studies exist in the literature that discuss the effects of diet on drug metabolism and how this can affect interindividual differences in systemic drug exposure. Several studies have investigated the effects of cruciferous vegetables (Cruciferae) or their constituents on drug-metabolizing activity, as these vegetables form an important part of many peoples’ diets. In general, the ingestion of cruciferous vegetables is associated with induction of cytochrome P450 (CYP) 1A2 activity in vivo; however, there is contention between reports, and the clinical significance of potential diet–drug interactions remains unclear. This study reports a systematic review, critical appraisal, and meta-analysis of the published literature in this area, and discusses the clinical significance of Cruciferae-enriched diets in the context of diet–drug interactions. Twenty-three dietary intervention trials with drug metabolism end points were identified across Embase, Medline, and the Cochrane Controlled Register of Trials (CENTRAL). Cruciferous vegetables represented in the literature included broccoli, Brussels sprout, cabbage, cauliflower, radish, and watercress. A range of phase I and II drug-metabolizing enzymes and phenotyping metrics were represented in the literature. The meta-analyses performed demonstrated a significant effect on CYP1A2 and glutathione S-transferase-alpha (GST-α), with consumption of Cruciferae increasing the activities of these enzymes by 20–40% and 15–35%, respectively. The results herein suggest that patients undergoing pharmacotherapy with CYP1A2 or GST-α substrates could have altered drug exposure profiles if they regularly eat large or variable amounts of cruciferous vegetables. Recommendations regarding the design of future randomized, controlled trials to test hypotheses in this area are included.",0

A search was performed on the Medline and Scopus electronic databases (2008-2019). Search terms were mice, brain, treadmill, physical exercise. In the total, 430 were found but only 103 were included. Animals n = 1,172; exercised 4-8 weeks (Range 24 h to 32 weeks), 60 min/day (Range 8-120 min per day), and 10/12 m/min (Range 0.2 m/min to 36 m/min). Hippocampus, cerebral cortex, striatum and whole brain were more frequently investigated. Exercise improved learning and memory. Meta-analysis showed that exercise increased: cerebral BDNF in health (n = 150; z = 5.8, CI 3.43-12.05; p < 0.001 I2 = 94.3 %), D (n = 124; z = 4.18, CI = 2.22-9.12; p < 0.001; I2 = 93.7 %) and PD (n = 16 z = 4.26, CI 5.03-48.73 p < 0.001 I2 = 94.8 %). TrkB improved in health (n = 84 z = 5.49, CI 3.8-17.73 p < 0.001, I2 = 0.000) and PD (n = 22; z = 3.1, CI = 2.58-67.3, p < 0.002 I2 = 93.8 %). Neurogenesis increased in health (n = 68; z = 7.08, CI 5.65-21.25 p < 0.001; I2 17.58) and D model (n = 116; z = 4.18, CI 2.22-9.12 p < 0.001 I2 93.7 %). Exercise augmented amyloid clearance (n = 166; z = 7.51 CI = 4.86-14.85, p < 0.001 I2 = 58.72) and reduced amyloid plaques in D models (n = 49; z = 4.65, CI = 3.94-15.3 p < 0.001 I2 = 0.000). In conclusion, exercise improved brain and behavior, neurogenesis in healthy and dementia models, reduced toxicity and cerebral amyloid. Evidence regarding inflammation, oxidative stress and energy metabolism were scarce. Studies examining acute vs chronic exercise, extreme training and the durability of exercise benefit were rare. Vascular or glucose metabolism changes were seldom reported.",0

To identify areas of improvement, the aim of our study was to review current use of HRV measurements in the surgical setting, evaluate the different methods used for the analysis of HRV, and to assess whether HRV is being measured correctly. Methods A systematic review was performed according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA). 17 studies regarding HRV as a measurement of mental stress in the surgical setting were included and analysed. Results 24% of the studies performed long-term measurements (24 h and longer) to assess the long-term effects of and recovery from mental stress. In 24% of the studies, artefact correction took place. Conclusions HRV showed to be a good objective assessment method of stress induced in the workplace environment: it was able to pinpoint stressors during operations, determine which operating techniques induced most stress for surgeons, and indicate differences in stress levels between performing and assisting surgery. For future research, this review recommends using singular guidelines to standardize research, and performing artefact correction. This will improve further evaluation of the long-term effects of mental stress and its recovery.",0

Thus, the available knowledge of its characteristics, management, and survival is scarce. Here, we present a systemic review of fibrous dysplasia that had undergone malignant transformation. A comprehensive search was performed on PubMed electronic database. The survival rates and hazard ratios of age, gender, past history of previous radiotherapy, type of FD, and treatment were collected from the published articles and analyzed. Forty-eight cases were eligible for inclusion in the study. Patient’s age, gender, past history radiotherapy, and type of FD did not influence the overall survival (OS). The Kaplan Meier analysis showed that the patients who had not received any treatment had poor prognosis with a median survival of 4 months. The patients that received surgery had significantly longer OS than that in the biopsy group. The prognosis of malignant transformation of FD is relatively poor, and surgery is the optimal treatment of choice. Nevertheless, the efficacy of postoperative adjuvant therapy to patient OS is still undefined.",0

We conducted a systematic review and meta-analyses to estimate the pooled association between the relative risk of each CVD endpoint and low-level As concentration in drinking water both linearly and non-linearly using a random effects dose-response model. In this study, a significant positive association was found between the risks of most CVD outcomes and drinking water As concentration for both linear and non-linear models (p-value for trend &lt; 0.05). Using the preferred linear model, we found significant increased risks of coronary heart disease (CHD) mortality and CVD mortality as well as combined fatal and non-fatal CHD, CVD, carotid atherosclerosis disease and hypertension in those exposed to drinking water with an As concentration of 10 µg/L compared to the referent (drinking water As concentration of 1 µg/L) population. Notwithstanding limitations included, the observed significant increased risks of CVD endpoints arising from As concentrations in drinking water between 1 µg/L and the 10 µg/L suggests further lowering of this guideline value should be considered.",1

A systematic review,"Lately, focus on the relation between Parkinson’s disease (PD) and Diabetes has risen greatly, as neuroprotective properties have been attributed to insulin use. Several studies have assessed the effect of glitazones, an insulin-sensitizing agent, in diabetic population on PD future risk. However, reports on the effect of their use have been heterogeneous. We aimed to synthesize the available scientific evidence which assesses the effect of glitazone use in type 2 diabetes patients on PD incidence. A systematic review was performed on multiple electronic databases. Considered for inclusion were studies that assessed the incidence of PD in type 2 diabetes glitazone users. Two reviewers worked independently and in duplicate to assess all studies, extract information and assess the methodological quality in each included study. Four high quality retrospective cohorts fulfilled inclusion criteria. Comparison groups varied across studies. In each study, incidence of PD was lower in glitazone-exposed patients compared to their respective comparison group. Pooled analysis showed lesser risk of PD in ever versus never glitazone users (RR 0.75 [95% C.I. 0.67–0.85; p < .0001; I2 = 0]). Our pooled analysis showed lesser risk of PD in glitazone versus non glitazone users, however, we advise to take results with caution since results are non-adjusted to possible confounding variables, furthermore, different glitazone-exposure time, follow up and comparison groups are aspects that also need to be pointed out. More clinical research focused on glitazone use and its relation with PD is needed, as this could result in new potential treatment modalities.",0

Background Although there is a widespread belief that the consideration of spiritual and religious needs is outdated in the context of secularism, from a practical perspective patients and families appear to benefit from spiritual support at the end of life. Methods Six key databases, CINAHL, MEDLINE, EMBASE, Global Health Library, Web of Science and Applied Social Sciences Index and Abstracts (ASSIA), were searched, and three reviewers independently extracted the data and coded them into themes and subthemes. The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) was used as a reporting framework. Results Five main themes emerged: anticipating needs; honouring the family by honouring the patient; personal connection; lack of sensitivity; and making space for religious and spiritual practices. Conclusions Families experiencing end-of-life care in acute hospital settings may benefit from spiritual care. While this can also be considered as fundamental care, understanding this through the lenses of spiritual care allows for incorporation of religious and spiritual practices that many seek at this time, irrespective of their faith perspectives. Relevance to clinical practice Although hospice care is well established internationally, many families experience end-of-life care in acute hospital settings. Nurses usually get to know families well during this time; however, the demands of the clinical environment place restrictions on family care and perceptions of lack of communication, limited support and/or limited sensitivity can compound families' suffering. Consideration of families' spiritual needs can help to support families during this time. Nurses are ideally placed for this and can anticipate and plan for patient and family needs in this regard, or refer to a specialist, such as the Healthcare Chaplain.",0

Of research including women, results are inconsistent on the impact of menstrual cycle phase on thermoregulation. Objectives The purpose of this systematic review is to quantify published investigations in thermal physiology that include menstrual cycle comparisons and assess aggregate data of investigations that include menstrual cycle variation and aerobic exercise in the heat. Methods 367 research articles were identified via systematic review and inclusion criteria and yielded 9 papers included in this analysis for a total number of 83 research subjects. Effect size estimates (Hedge's g) were utilized for initial (pre-exercise) and post-exercise internal body temperature (rectal or esophageal, Tint), sweat rate, mean skin temperature, and exercise heart rate. Results Pooled effect size showed significantly greater initial Tint (1.231 ± 0.186, p  Conclusions The limited available data suggest that observed increases in initial Tint in the luteal phase are maintained throughout and post-exercise without an observed impact in sweat rate or mean skin temperature.",0
https://doi.org/10.1111/ijd.14811,Stevens‐Johnson syndrome and toxic epidermal necrolysis‐like reactions to checkpoint inhibitors: a systematic review,"The use of checkpoint inhibitors for treatment of advanced malignancies is increasing. Rashes, pruritus, and more rarely, reactions resembling Stevens-Johnsons syndrome (SJS) or toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN) may occur secondary to checkpoint inhibitors. To characterize existing literature on these reports, we queried the PubMed/MEDLINE database for cases of SJS or TEN associated with checkpoint inhibitors. We identified 18 cases of SJS or TEN-like reactions to checkpoint inhibitors in the literature. There were 12 cases of SJS-like rashes with median time to onset of 5.6 weeks (average of 8.9 weeks), of which five were delayed to week 8 or later from checkpoint inhibitor initiation. The five TEN-like reactions had a median time to onset of 4 weeks (average of 5.38 weeks), of which two were delayed to week 6 or later. SJS/TEN-like reactions to nivolumab (seven cases) had median onset time of 3 weeks, whereas five cases secondary to pembrolizumab had median onset time of 11 weeks. Seven cases in this study described prodromal rashes, which varied from localized papular rashes to generalized morbilliform rashes, prior to evolution into SJS or TEN-like patterns. SJS-like patterns generally improved well on systemic treatment/supportive care and no cases of death were identified, but mortality occurred in three of five patients with TEN-like reactions. Dermatologists should consider the possibility for unique features of SJS/TEN in response to checkpoint inhibitors. Additional studies will be necessary to further characterize SJS/TEN-like eruptions on checkpoint inhibitors and determine the optimal management of these cases.",0

Methods Systematic reviews were conducted of published controlled trials of treatments for unresectable or metastatic HER2-positive BC with early relapse (≤ 6 months) following adjuvant therapy or progression after trastuzumab (Tras) + taxane published from January 1998 to January 2018. Random-effects NMA was conducted for overall survival (OS), progression-free survival (PFS), overall response rate (ORR), and safety endpoints. Results The NMA included regimens from seven randomized controlled trials: T-DM1 and combinations of Tras, capecitabine (Cap), lapatinib (Lap), neratinib, or pertuzumab (Per; unapproved). OS results favored T-DM1 over approved comparators: hazard ratio (HR) (95% credible interval [95% CrI]) vs Cap 0.68 (0.39, 1.10), LapCap 0.76 (0.51, 1.07), TrasCap 0.78 (0.44, 1.19). PFS trends favored T-DM1 over all other treatments: HR (95% CrI) vs Cap 0.38 (0.19, 0.74), LapCap 0.65 (0.40, 1.10), TrasCap 0.62 (0.34, 1.18); ORR with T-DM1 was more favorable than with all approved treatments. In surface under cumulative ranking curve (SUCRA) analysis T-DM1 ranked highest for all efficacy outcomes. Discontinuation due to adverse events was less likely with T-DM1 than with all comparators except neratinib. In general, gastrointestinal side effects were less likely and elevated liver transaminases and thrombocytopenia more likely with T-DM1 than with comparators. Conclusions The efficacy and tolerability profiles of T-DM1 are generally favorable compared with other treatments for unresectable or metastatic HER2-positive BC.",0

Failure to adequately prepare adolescents for transfer to adult care can lead to a decline in attendance to the adult clinic and an increase in the rate of non-adherence to medical treatment. The aim of this systematic review was to analyze studies exploring the experiences of adolescents, parents, and health professionals regarding the transition process of adolescents with CKD. Six databases were searched from inception to October 2018 for primary research articles. Eleven articles met the inclusion criteria, with only one exploring the parents' experiences. The results indicated that up to 50% of adolescents did not feel prepared to transfer to adult care at the time of transfer, and the timing was not ideal for some adolescents. Health professionals acknowledged that adolescents and parents felt emotional attachment to the pediatric unit, which led to anxiety about transferring. Once in adult care, adolescents felt out of place among the older patients, overwhelmed by the environment and the lack of attention from health professionals. Initiatives that could support transfer include allowing adolescents to attend pediatric consultation independently and meeting with adult health professionals prior to transfer. This review found that the transition process must be more responsive to adolescents by tailoring the timing of transfer according to their ability to assume self-care responsibility. In addition, there is a need to focus on the parents and their role in the transition process.",0

The interconception period may be an important time to intervene. We systematically identified studies examining change in modifiable maternal exposures between pregnancies and offspring adiposity. We searched for longitudinal studies published between 1990 and 2019, which included measurements taken on at least two occasions in the period from 1 year prior to the conception of the first birth to the time of the second birth, and which included a measure of adiposity in second, or higher order, siblings. Age, ethnicity and genetics were not considered modifiable; all other factors including length of the interpregnancy interval were. Eleven studies satisfied the inclusion criteria. Higher interpregnancy weight gain or loss, maternal smoking inception, mothers smoking in their first pregnancy and quitting, increasing the number of cigarettes smoked and longer interpregnancy intervals were positively associated with adiposity in second or higher order children. Vaginal birth after caesarean delivery was protective. Further research is needed to ascertain whether the risk of adiposity is fixed based on first pregnancy exposures or if interpregnancy change alters the risk for a subsequent child. This can inform the type and effectiveness of interventions for mothers prior to a subsequent pregnancy.",0

The presence of Programmed Death-Ligand 1 protein (PD-L1) in oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) may indicate an ability to evade immune response and has been suggested as a prognostic marker, but there is controversy in the literature. To review the scientific evidence of a prognostic role for PD-L1 levels in OSCC. PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, and Scopus were searched for studies published on or before March 02, 2019. Studies measuring PD-L1 levels by immunohistochemistry (IHC) in OSCC were included. Study quality was assessed using the QUIPS tool. Meta-analysis was performed for survival outcomes and clinic-pathological parameters. 26 articles were included comprising 2532 patients. Analysis of studies measuring PD-L1 expression in the cell membrane showed a worse prognosis for disease-specific survival (HR = 1.74, 95% CI = 1.14–2.66, p = 0.01) and disease-free survival (HR = 1.56, 95% CI = 1.16–2.09, p = 0.003). PD-L1 overexpression was more likely in females (OR = 0.69, 95% CI = 0.53–0.91, p = 0.008), non-smokers (OR = 0.45, 95% CI = 0.27–0.75, p = 0.002), non-drinkers (OR = 0.40, 95% CI = 0.16–0.97, p = 0.04), advance stage tumours (OR = 1.63, 95% CI = 1.00–2.64, p = 0.05) and in tumours with high levels of PD-1 (OR = 33.36, 95% CI = 1.88–591.69, p = 0.02), CD4+ (OR = 3.25, 95% CI = 1.36–7.76, p = 0.008) and CD8+ (OR = 3.63 , 95% CI = 1.20–10.99, p = 0.02). This meta-analysis found a worse prognosis in OSCCs overexpressing PD-L1 in the cell membrane as measured by disease specific survival and disease-free survival. We also found positive correlations between PD-L1 overexpression and advanced tumours, females, non-smokers, non-drinkers and high levels of tumour PD-1, CD4, and CD8.",0

Nontraditional approaches to management, including testis-sparing surgery (TSS) and scrotal orchiectomy, occur in clinical practice. We systematically reviewed studies evaluating outcomes after TSS and scrotal violation for the management of a suspected TGCT. We used PubMed, Embase, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (January 1980-December 2018) to search for studies addressing morbidity and oncologic outcomes after TSS or scrotal violation for testicular masses concerning for TGCT. Paired reviewers independently screened abstracts for inclusion, sequentially extracted data, and assessed study quality. Twenty-one studies were included (10 TSS, 11 scrotal violation). Risk of local recurrence after TSS on meta-analysis was 7.5% after 3 to 5 years (absolute proportion reported in studies: 10.9%). Aggregated rates of positive margins (1.4%) and testicular atrophy (2.8%) across studies were low with 7.1% of patients requiring subsequent androgen therapy. Scrotal violation led to a higher aggregate risk of local recurrence compared to no scrotal violation (2.5% vs. 0.0%, P < 0.001) but did not appear to impact subsequent metastasis and survival in the short term (3-5 years). Most patients received adjuvant therapy after scrotal violation with 9.3% found to harbor residual primary tumor after scrotal scar excision. TSS carries a quantifiable risk of local recurrence after 3 to 5 years despite the majority receiving adjuvant radiation or chemotherapy. Scrotal violation carries a risk of local recurrence but does not appear to impact subsequent metastasis and survival in the short term.",0
https://doi.org/10.1017/s1092852920000115,Mental health consequences for survivors of the 2011 Fukushima nuclear disaster: a systematic review. Part 2: emotional and behavioral consequences,"To compile the findings of studies assessing emotional and behavioral changes in the survivors of the 2011 Fukushima nuclear disaster, we performed a systematic review in August 2019 using four literature databases (PubMed, PsycINFO, Psychology and Behavioral Sciences Collection, and ICHUSHI). Peer-reviewed manuscripts, either in English or Japanese, were included in the searches. Sixty-one studies were retrieved for the review. Of these, 41 studies (67.2%) assessed emotional consequences, 28 studies (45.9%) evaluated behavioral consequences, and 8 studies (13.1%) evaluated both emotional and behavioral outcomes. The main research topic in emotional change was radiation exposure-associated risk perception, as reported in 15 studies. This risk perception included immediate health effects (eg, acute radiation syndrome) as well as future health effects (eg, future cancer and genetic effects). Lowered subjective well-being was reported in eight studies. Six studies reported perceived discrimination/stigmatization in the disaster survivors. The most critical behavioral change was an increase in suicides compared with residents in the whole of Japan or affected by the earthquake and tsunami, but not by the nuclear disaster. Increased rate of alcohol and tobacco use was reported, although the effect on one's health was inconsistent. As a conclusion, the Fukushima nuclear disaster survivors suffered issues in risk perception, well-being, stigmatization, and alcohol/tobacco use in the first 8 years after the disaster. The present study is important in order to better understand the emotional and behavioral responses to future nuclear/radiological disasters as well as other ""invisible"" disasters, such as chemical and biological public health crises.",0
https://doi.org/10.1186/s13643-020-01301-0,Rates of compliance and adherence to high-intensity interval training in insufficiently active adults: a systematic review and meta-analysis protocol,"Abstract Background Both high-intensity interval training and moderate-intensity continuous training demonstrate beneficial physiological outcomes for active and insufficiently active populations. However, it remains unclear whether compliance to exercise in supervised settings translates to long-term adherence to physical activity in real-world, unstructured environments. To our knowledge, no comprehensive review is available on compliance and/or adherence rates to either modes of exercise for insufficiently active individuals. Furthermore, it is unclear which training modality insufficiently active individuals comply and/or adhere more readily to. Based on these gaps, the following two questions will be addressed: (1) What are compliance and adherence rates to high-intensity interval training for insufficiently active adults aged 18–65 years and (2) How do compliance and adherence rates differ between high-intensity interval training and moderate-intensity continuous training? Methods Both observational and experimental studies that report on compliance and/or adherence rates to high-intensity interval training will be included. Relevant studies will be retrieved from Medline, EMBASE, PsychINFO, SPORTDiscus, CINAHL, and Web of Science using a pre-specified search strategy. Pre-defined inclusion and exclusion criteria will be used by two independent researchers to determine eligible studies. Of those meeting the inclusion criteria, data extraction and narrative synthesis will be completed, and where applicable, random-effects meta-analyses will be computed to compare compliance and adherence rates between high-intensity interval training and moderate-intensity continuous training. Meta-regressions and sensitivity analyses will be used to further explore factors that could influence aggregate effect sizes. Risk of bias will be assessed using established tools by the Cochrane association, and quality assessment of the cumulative evidence will be assessed using the GRADE approach. Discussion Results from this study may have the potential to inform future physical activity recommendations and guidelines on the ideal mode of exercise for the general population. This review will add to the body of literature on the feasibility of high-intensity interval training for an insufficiently active population, conclusively addressing the ongoing debate of whether it is an appropriate exercise choice for this demographic. With this new information, individuals working towards a healthier lifestyle through physical activity engagement may be better equipped to make an evidence-based decision.

https://doi.org/10.1111/bcpt.13343,Interaction potential between clarithromycin and individual statins—A systematic review,"The high prevalence of statin and clarithromycin utilization creates potential for overlapping use. The objectives of this MiniReview were to investigate the evidence base for drug-drug interactions between clarithromycin and currently marketed statins and to present management strategies for these drug combinations. We conducted a systematic literature review following PRISMA guidelines with English language studies retrieved from PubMed and EMBASE (from inception through March 2019). We included 29 articles (16 case reports, 5 observational, 5 clinical pharmacokinetic and 3 in vitro studies). Based on mechanistic/clinical studies involving clarithromycin or the related macrolide erythromycin (both strong inhibitors of CYP3A4 and of hepatic statin uptake transporters OATP1B1 and OATP1B3), clarithromycin is expected to substantially increase systemic exposure to simvastatin and lovastatin (>5-fold increase in area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC)), moderately increase AUCs of atorvastatin and pitavastatin (2- to 4-fold AUC increase) and slightly increase pravastatin exposure (≈2-fold AUC increase) while having little effect on fluvastatin or rosuvastatin. The 16 cases of statin-clarithromycin adverse drug reactions (rhabdomyolysis (n = 14) or less severe clinical myopathy) involved a CYP3A4-metabolized statin (simvastatin, lovastatin or atorvastatin). In line, a cohort study found concurrent use of clarithromycin and CYP3A4-metabolized statins to be associated with a doubled risk of hospitalization with rhabdomyolysis or other statin-related adverse events as compared with azithromycin-statin co-administration. If clarithromycin is necessary, we recommend (a) avoiding co-administration with simvastatin, lovastatin or atorvastatin; (b) withholding or dose-reducing pitavastatin; (c) continuing pravastatin therapy with caution, limiting pravastatin dose to 40 mg daily; and (d) continuing fluvastatin or rosuvastatin with caution.",0

Electronic search of PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, and Cochrane Collaboration was conducted till end of 2018. Pooled estimates were performed using a fixed-effects model or random-effects model. A total of 22 studies included in the meta-analyses. Subgroup analyses on sample type (maternal urine, maternal blood, cord blood, and placenta), meta-regression, and sensitivity analysis were performed to seek the sources of heterogeneity. In the random-effects meta-analysis of included studies, the pooled correlation coefficient between maternal exposure to Cd with birth weight was − 0.04 [95% CI (− 0.07, − 0.01), with birth length and head circumference as − 0.01 [95% CI (− 0.04, 0.02)] and − 0.02 [95% CI (− 0.06, 0.02)].

https://doi.org/10.1007/s00192-020-04252-1,Effect of oestrogen therapy on faecal incontinence in postmenopausal women: a systematic review,"Abstract Introduction and hypothesis Faecal incontinence (FI) is prevalent in postmenopausal women. Oestrogen receptors have been identified in the anal sphincter and have been implicated in the pathogenesis and potential treatment. We sought to evaluate the literature regarding the impact of local and systemic oestrogen therapy on FI in postmenopausal women. Methods A systematic review of all studies in postmenopausal women was performed to establish how oestrogen therapy affects FI. Eight articles were deemed eligible for inclusion following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. Their quality was assessed using the Cochrane risk-of-bias tool (RoB-2) and Newcastle–Ottawa quality assessment scale. Results One randomised controlled trial (RCT), two cohort studies, one observational and four cross-sectional studies were identified. The RCT showed an improvement in FI with anal oestrogen ( p = 0.002), but this improvement was also observed in the placebo arm ( p = 0.013) and no difference was seen between these groups. A prospective observational study demonstrated significant improvement with an oestrogen patch ( p = 0.004), but had no control group. Conversely, a large prospective cohort study demonstrated an increased hazard ratio of FI with current (1.32; 95% CI, 1.20–1.45) and previous oestrogen use (1.26; 95% CI, 1.18–1.34) compared with non-users. Conclusion All studies had a high risk of bias and had conflicting views on the effects of oestrogen on FI in postmenopausal women. This review has identified the need for further research in this area by highlighting the paucity of good research for evidence-based practice. We believe that a further RCT of local oestrogen is mandated to draw a valid conclusion.",0
https://doi.org/10.3399/bjgp20x709877,Contribution of paramedics in primary and urgent care: a systematic review,"Background Within the UK, there are now opportunities for paramedics to work across a variety of healthcare settings away from their traditional ambulance service employer, with many opting to move into primary care. Aim To provide an overview of the types of clinical roles paramedics are undertaking in primary and urgent care settings within the UK. Design and setting A systematic review. Method Searches were conducted of MEDLINE, CINAHL, Embase, the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence, the Journal of Paramedic Practice , and the Cochrane Database from January 2004 to March 2019 for papers detailing the role, scope of practice, clinician and patient satisfaction, and costs of paramedics in primary and urgent care settings. Free-text keywords and subject headings focused on two key concepts: paramedic and general practice/primary care. Results In total, 6765 references were screened by title and/or abstract. After full-text review, 24 studies were included. Key findings focused on the description of the clinical role, the clinical work environment, the contribution of paramedics to the primary care workforce, the clinical activities they undertook, patient satisfaction, and education and training for paramedics moving from the ambulance service into primary care. Conclusion Current published research identifies that the role of the paramedic working in primary and urgent care is being advocated and implemented across the UK; however, there is insufficient detail regarding the clinical contribution of paramedics in these clinical settings. More research needs to be done to determine how, why, and in what context paramedics are now working in primary and urgent care, and what their overall contribution is to the primary care workforce.",0

The objective of this study was to estimate its correlation with clinicopathological and prognostic significance in HNSCC.Two authors systematically searched the studies independently with keywords in PubMed, Web of science, Embase, the Cochrane database, the CNKI database, the Science citation index and the references of relevant studies (up to February 2019). Odds ratio (OR), risk ratio (RR), pooled hazard ratio (HR) and 95% confidence intervals (95%CI) were calculated as effect values.Twenty studies containing 1054 patients with HNSCC were included in this meta-analysis. The CTC-positive rate was higher in the T3-T4 group (RR = 1.29, 95% CI [1.11, 1.49], I2 = 47.3%), the N1-N3 group (RR = 1.18, 95% CI [1.02, 1.36], I2 = 12.4%) and the III-IV group (RR = 1.13, 95% CI [1.02, 1.25], I2 = 0%). Positive CTCs were significant associated with overall survival (HR = 1.37, 95% CI [0.59, 2.15], I2 = 9.7%), progression-free survival (HR = 3.40, 95%CI [1.47, 5.32], I2 = 0%), and disease-free survival (HR = 3.57, 95%CI [1.06, 6.08], I2 = 81%).Our meta-analysis results indicated that CTCs are significant associated with prognosis of patients with HNSCC. The presence of CTCs can be used as a monitoring tool for survival prognosis of HNSCC patients in the future.",0

A systematic review was conducted that conformed to the PRISMA guidelines using a registered protocol (CRD42019127307). The primary outcomes were peri-operative mortality, freedom from aneurysm related mortality, and overall survival. Pooled estimates of dichotomous outcomes were calculated using odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval (CI). A time to event data meta-analysis was conducted using the inverse variance method and the results were reported as summary hazard ratio (HR) and associated 95% CI. Subgroup analysis for type of treatment (endovascular aneurysm repair [EVAR] or open repair) was undertaken. Random effects models of meta-analysis were developed.Ten observational studies were included reporting a total of 1284 patients (748 with hostile anatomy and 536 with friendly anatomy). Patients with hostile anatomy had a higher peri-operative mortality than patients with friendly anatomy (OR 1.73, 95% CI 1.13-2.66; p = .01). Subgroup analysis showed a significant difference in peri-operative mortality in favour of friendly anatomy in patients treated by EVAR (OR 1.76, 95% CI 1.01-3.08; p = .05), but not in those treated by open repair (OR 1.37, 95% CI 0.83-2.27; p = .22). Patients with hostile anatomy treated by EVAR had a significantly higher hazard of death in follow up than patients with friendly aortic anatomy (HR 2.01, 95% CI 1.18-3.44, p = .01), whereas for open surgical repair, the survival was similar in patients with hostile and those with friendly aortic anatomy (HR 0.90, 95% CI 0.61-1.32, p = .58).Hostile aortic anatomy is associated with increased mortality in patients with ruptured AAA treated by EVAR.",0
https://doi.org/10.1007/s00420-020-01516-7,A systematic review on the effect of work-related stressors on mental health of young workers,"There is no review on the effect of work-related stressors on mental health of young workers. We systematically reviewed epidemiological evidence on this relationship. The review searched eight databases: Embase, PubMed, Web of Science, Cinahl, Cochrane Library, Informit, PsycINFO, and Scopus from their respective start dates until May 2017. Studies that have examined a mental health outcome in relation to a work-related stressor as exposure in young workers were included. The review was reported based on the PRISMA statement. Three cross-sectional studies and six longitudinal cohort studies were included. Cross-sectional evidence showed that adverse work conditions including working overtime, job boredom, low skill variety, low autonomy, high job insecurity, and lack of reward were associated with poor mental health of young workers. Longitudinal evidence showed that high job demands, low job control, effort-reward imbalance, and low work support (men only) were associated with poor mental health. There was evidence on the contemporaneous relationship between two or more adverse work conditions and poor mental health. Although more research (particularly high-quality longitudinal studies) is warranted in this area, our review indicates that work-related stressors have a negative impact on the mental health of young workers. The current review suggests that workplace interventions and policy are required to improve the quality of work for young workers.",1
https://doi.org/10.1016/j.toxlet.2020.04.006,Urinary 8-isoprostane as a biomarker for oxidative stress. A systematic review and meta-analysis,"Oxidative stress is defined as an imbalance between the production and elimination of reactive oxygen species (ROS) are associated with various inflammation-related human disease. ROS can oxidize lipids, which subsequently undergo fragmentation to produce F2-isoprostanes (F2-IsoPs). Eight-isoprostane is one of the most extensively studied F2-IsoPs and the most commonly used biomarker for the assessment of oxidative stress in human studies. This urinary biomarker is quantified using either chemical or immunological techniques. A ""physiological"" range for 8-isoprostanes is needed to use this biomarker as a measure of excess oxidative stress originating from occupational exposures. However, ranges reported in the literature are inconsistent. We designed a standardized protocol of a systematic review and meta-analysis to assess baseline values for 8-isoprostane concentrations in urine of healthy adults and identify determinants of their inter- and intra-individual variability. We searched PubMed from journal inception and up to April 2019, and screened articles for studies containing F2-IsoPs concentrations in urine for healthy adult participants. We grouped studies in three biomarker groups: ""8-isoprostane"", ""Isoprostanes"" ""15- F2t-Isoprostane"". We computed geometric mean (GM) and geometric standard deviation (GSD) as the basis for the meta-analysis. Of the initial 1849 articles retrieved, 63 studies were included and 107 subgroups within these study populations were identified. We stratified the subgroups analyzed with the chemical methods by body mass index (BMI) reported. We provide pooled GM values for urinary 8-isoprostane concentrations in healthy adults, separately for chemical and immunological analysis in this review. The interquartile range (IQR) in subgroups with a mean BMI below 25 measured using chemical methods was 0.18 to 0.40 μg/g creatinine. We show that there is a significant positive association between BMI and urinary 8-isoprostane concentrations. We recommend adjusting urinary 8-isoprostane concentrations in spot urine with creatinine, quantifying 8-isoprostane with chemical analytical methods, and reporting results as median and quartiles. This will help in comparing results across studies.",0

Therefore, a meta-analysis was performed with the aim of pooling results from studies on the relationship between smoking and sleep-related issues. The present study follows PRISMA guidelines. Databases were searched by both researchers to find the articles. The review was done up to December 2018. In order to analyze the results of the screened articles, statistical indexes were converted to logarithms and the studies were combined with each other. Finally, several analyses were conducted with respect to various subgroups. In the subgroup analysis, the pool index of the studies was determined and the degree of heterogeneity in each subgroup was presented. Meta-regression was also used. Smoking is associated with a risk of developing sleep-related issues. Risk ratio (1.47; 1.20–1.79) for smokers was higher than for non-smokers. Egger’s test and Begg’s test indicated publication bias. Smoking is associated with sleep-related issues. Informing smokers about the effects of smoking on sleep issues can be effective in reducing and preventing its consequences.",0
https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jhep.2020.02.030,Chronic hepatitis D and hepatocellular carcinoma: A systematic review and meta-analysis of observational studies,"Background & Aims Chronic hepatitis D (CHD) is the most severe form of chronic viral hepatitis but its role in the development of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) remains debated. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of epidemiological studies to examine whether CHD is associated with an increased risk of HCC. Methods We searched PubMed, Embase and Web of Science, as well as study references and conference proceedings. We considered cohort and case-control studies allowing the calculation of effect estimates for the association between CHD (exposure) and HCC (outcome) in comparison to chronic hepatitis B. Data extraction and quality evaluation (using the Newcastle-Ottawa scale) were performed independently by 2 authors. Data were pooled using random-effects models. Results Ninety-three studies (68 case-control studies including 22,862 patients and 25 cohort studies including 75,427 patients) were included. Twelve studies accounted for confounders, in either study design or analysis (10 of which were cohorts), and 11 cohorts were prospective. The overall analysis showed a significantly increased risk of HCC in patients with CHD, despite substantial study heterogeneity (pooled odds ratio 1.28; 95% CI 1.05–1.57; I2 = 67.0%). The association was particularly strong in the absence of heterogeneity for prospective cohort studies (pooled odds ratio 2.77; 95% CI 1.79–4.28; I2 = 0%), and studies with HIV-infected patients (pooled odds ratio 7.13; 95% CI 2.83–17.92; I2 = 0%). Conclusions We found a significantly higher risk of HCC in patients with CHD. Although further studies are needed to definitively exclude a potential bias due to antiviral treatments, our findings highlight the rationale for improved screening of hepatitis D virus infection in patients with chronic hepatitis B, and the urgent need for novel and effective antiviral therapies. Lay summary Hepatitis D virus (HDV) is a defective pathogen requiring hepatitis B virus (HBV) to complete its life cycle. Chronic hepatitis D is the most severe form of chronic viral hepatitis, increasing the risk of cirrhosis, liver decompensation and death compared to HBV monoinfection. However, the association between HDV infection and increased risk of hepatocellular carcinoma is debated. We conducted a systematic review and found that patients with HDV infection had a significantly higher risk of developing hepatocellular carcinoma than those with HBV monoinfection.",0

Studies have suggested that the Gleason grade (GG) at the PSM could improve predictive accuracy and decision making. Our objective was to systematically review the reported data to determine the effect of the GG at the PSM on the prognosis after radical prostatectomy. A systematic review was conducted by searching MEDLINE/PubMed for studies reported by June 2019 in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review statement. The keywords used included prostate cancer, radical prostatectomy, positive surgical margin, Gleason score, and/or Gleason grade. After a systematic literature review, 10 studies were included, comprising 14,108 patients, of whom 2454 (17.4%) had a PSM and 428 (14%) eventually experienced biochemical recurrence (BCR) within a median follow-up of 18 to 156 months. Data on neoadjuvant or adjuvant therapy were not estimable. In a meta-analysis, GG4 at PSM was significantly associated with BCR compared with GG3 (pooled hazard ratio, 1.87; 95% confidence interval, 1.53-2.28; z = 6.16). The Cochrane Q test (χ2 = 5.88; P = .318) and I2 test (I2 = 15.0%) showed that no significant heterogeneity was present. GG4 at a PSM is a feature of biologically and clinically aggressive prostate cancer that is associated with a significant increase risk of BCR. GG at PSM should be recorded in each pathological report. Given this adverse prognostic value patients with GG4 at the PSM should be considered for multimodal therapy such as radiotherapy.",0
https://doi.org/10.21037/jtd.2020.02.31,Optical imaging versus CT and plain radiography to quantify pectus severity: a systematic review and meta-analysis,"Computed tomography (CT) and two-view chest radiographies are the most commonly used imaging techniques to quantify the severity of pectus excavatum (PE) and pectus carinatum (PC). Both modalities expose patients to ionizing radiation that should ideally be avoided, especially in pediatric patients. In an effort to diminish this exposure, three-dimensional (3D) optical surface imaging has recently been proposed as an alternative method. To assess its clinical value as a tool to determine pectus severity we conducted a systematic review in which we assessed all studies that compared 3D scan-based pectus severity measurements with those derived from CT-scans and radiographies.Six scientific databases and three registries were searched through April 30th, 2019. Data regarding the correlation between severity measures was extracted and submitted to meta-analysis using the random-effects model and I2-test for heterogeneity.Five observational studies were included, enrolling 75 participants in total. Pooled analysis of participants with PE demonstrated a high positive correlation coefficient of 0.89 [95% confidence interval (CI): 0.81 to 0.93; P<0.001] between the CT-derived Haller index (HI) and its 3D scan equivalent based on external measures. No heterogeneity was detected (I2=0.00%; P=0.834).3D optical surface scanning is an attractive and promising imaging technique to determine the severity of PE without exposure to ionizing radiation. However, further research is needed to determine novel cut-off values for 3D scans to facilitate clinical decision making and help determine surgical candidacy. No evidence was found that supports nor discards the use of 3D scans to determine PC severity.",0

The objective was to explore the characteristics of patients with DRESS secondary to phenytoin through a systematic review.Methods: We describe a case of DRESS syndrome secondary to phenytoin in a patient with previous exposure to this drug. A systematic literature review of cases of phenytoin-induced DRESS syndrome was conducted in PubMed/Medline, Scopus and Web of Science until May 2019.Results: 37 articles describing 40 cases of DRESS syndrome were selected. Mean age of onset was 33 years, without gender difference. Symptoms started between two and 90 days (mean ± 23 days). Liver and respiratory tract were most frequently involved, and eosinophilia was a common feature, it was presented with an average value of 9.7%. A discussion of the case and qualitative synthesis of the evidence reported in the literature were made.Conclusion: Patients and presentation characteristics will mostly be presented according to the criteria used by RegiSCAR. It is recommended to consider adequate monitoring of adverse reactions to antiepileptic drugs such as DRESS syndrome, given its severity and high lethality.",0
https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjmilitary-2019-001375,Fracture union rates across a century of war: a systematic review of the literature,"Introduction Fractures have been a common denominator of the injury patterns observed over the past century of warfare. The fractures typified by the blast and ballistic injuries of war lead to high rates of bone loss, soft tissue injury and infection, greatly increasing the likelihood of non-union. Despite this, no reliable treatment strategy for non-union exists. This literature review aims to explore the rates of non-union across a century of conflict, in order to determine whether our ability to heal the fractures of war has improved. Methods A systematic review of the literature was conducted, evaluating the rates of union in fractures sustained in a combat environment over a 100-year period. Only those fractures sustained through a ballistic or blast mechanism were included. The review was in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses. Quality and bias assessment was also undertaken. Results Thirty studies met the inclusion criteria, with a total of 3232 fractures described across 15 different conflicts from the period 1919–2019. Male subjects made up 96% of cases, and tibial fractures predominated (39%). The lowest fracture union rate observed in a series was 50%. Linear regression analysis demonstrated that increasing years had no statistically significant impact on union rate. Conclusions Failure to improve fracture union rates is likely a result of numerous factors, including greater use of blast weaponry and better survivability of casualties. Finding novel strategies to promote fracture healing is a key defence research priority in order to improve the rates of fractures sustained in a combat environment.",0
https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neubiorev.2020.02.019,Childhood maltreatment and DNA methylation: A systematic review,"DNA methylation (DNAm) - an epigenetic process that regulates gene expression - may represent a mechanism for the biological embedding of early traumatic experiences, including childhood maltreatment. Here, we conducted the first systematic review of human studies linking childhood maltreatment to DNAm. In total, 72 studies were included in the review (2008-2018). The majority of extant studies (i) were based on retrospective data in adults, (ii) employed a candidate gene approach (iii) focused on global maltreatment, (iv) were based on easily accessible peripheral tissues, typically blood; and (v) were cross-sectional. Two-thirds of studies (n = 48) also examined maltreatment-related outcomes, such as stress reactivity and psychiatric symptoms. While findings generally support an association between childhood maltreatment and altered patterns of DNAm, factors such as the lack of longitudinal data, low comparability across studies as well as potential genetic and 'pre-exposure' environmental confounding currently limit the conclusions that can be drawn. Key challenges are discussed and concrete recommendations for future research are provided to move the field forward.",0
https://doi.org/10.1177/1524838018772293,Global Posttrauma Symptoms: A Systematic Review of Qualitative Literature,"Exposure to potentially traumatic events is a global health problem, especially in low- and middle-income countries. Assessments for symptoms resulting from trauma exposure rely heavily on the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, fifth edition (DSM-5) criteria for post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), which may not be relevant in all regions of the globe. We examined posttrauma symptoms that were not limited to Western constructs of mental health (i.e., PTSD). In a systematic review, we searched nine databases to identify posttrauma symptoms arising in qualitative literature published before July 17, 2017. A total of 17,938 records were identified and 392 met inclusion criteria. The 392 studies represented data on 400 study populations from 71 different nationalities/ethnicities. The presence and frequency of posttrauma symptoms were examined across all regions. Fisher’s exact tests were also conducted to compare frequencies in posttrauma symptoms across region and gender. Based on a weighted analysis across regions, a list of global posttrauma symptoms ( N = 85) was compiled into an item bank. We found that the majority of DSM-5 PTSD symptoms were mentioned across regions (with the exception of inability to recall specific aspects of the trauma and blame of self or others for the event). Across all regions, we also found a number of symptoms mentioned that were not part of PTSD and its associated features. Findings suggest that assessing posttrauma symptoms solely based on PTSD may be limiting to global populations. Research, policy, and practice implications are discussed.",0

A systematic review of reviews,"The importance of policy for promoting physical activity (PA) is increasingly recognized by academics, and there is a push by national governments and international institutions for PA policy development and monitoring. However, our knowledge about which policies are actually effective to promote PA remains limited. This article summarizes the currently available evidence by reviewing existing reviews on the subject. Building on results from a previous scoping review on different types of PA-related evidence, we ran searches for combinations of the terms ""physical activity"", ""evidence"", ""effect"", ""review"", and ""policy"" in six different databases (PubMed, Scopus, SportDiscus, PsycInfo, ERIC, and IBSS). We used EPPI Reviewer 4 to further process the results and conduct an in-depth analysis. We identified 57 reviews providing evidence on 53 types of policies and seven broader groups of policies. Reviews fell into four main categories: 1) setting- and target group-specific; 2) urban design, environment and transport; 3) economic instruments; and 4) broad-range perspective. Results indicate that there is solid evidence for policy effectiveness in some areas (esp. school-based and infrastructural policies) but that the evidence in other areas is insufficient (esp. for economic policies). The available evidence provides some guidance for policy-makers regarding which policies can currently be recommended as effective. However, results also highlight some broader epistemological issues deriving from the current research. This includes the conflation of PA policies and PA interventions, the lack of appropriate tools for benchmarking individual policies, and the need to critically revisit research methodologies for collating evidence on policies.",0

We aimed to disclose their prognostic significance by conducting a meta-analysis of all the published data from the last decade.Electronic database searches were conducted in PubMed, Embase, and Web of Science for relevant articles published within the last ten years. The pooled hazard ratio (HR) and corresponding 95% confidence interval (CI) were obtained to evaluate the prognostic values of the target factors.A total of 18,126 patients from 40 studies were eventually included. Results indicated that gender (male vs. female: 1.21, 95% CI, 1.11-1.32; female vs. male: 0.85, 95% CI, 0.75-0.98), age (12-20 vs. ≤12: 1.37, 95% CI, 1.13-1.65; ≥20 vs. <20: 1.29, 95% CI, 1.08-1.55; ≥40 vs. <40: 1.63, 95% CI, 1.21-2.20; ≥50 vs. <25: 2.60, 95% CI, 1.92-3.53; ≥60 vs. <60: 1.11, 95% CI, 1.06-1.18), tumor location (non-extremities vs. extremities: 2.10, 95% CI, 1.76-2.51; proximal vs. distal femur: 3.68, 95% CI: 1.51-8.96; proximal vs. distal humerus: 3.15, 95% CI: 1.53-6.49), tumor size (≥5 vs. <5: 1.42, 95% CI, 1.09-1.86; >8 vs. ≤8: 1.55, 95% CI, 1.07-2.24; >9 vs. ≤9: 1.44, 95% CI, 1.05-1.96), chemotherapy response (poor vs. good: 2.45, 95% CI, 2.02-2.97; good vs. poor: 0.41, 95% CI, 0.34-0.48), and surgery (yes vs. no: 0.45, 95% CI, 0.36-0.57; amputation vs. salvage: 2.34, 95% CI, 1.47-3.74) were significantly associated with overall survival in osteosarcoma patients.The meta-analysis demonstrated that male patients, older age, large tumor size, non-extremity osteosarcoma, proximal osteosarcoma, poor chemotherapy response, no surgical treatment, and amputation surgery were correlated with a poor prognosis in osteosarcoma patients.",0
https://doi.org/10.1111/1759-7714.13451,Radiation dose escalation with modified fractionation schedules for locally advanced <scp>NSCLC</scp> : A systematic review,"Concomitant chemo-radiotherapy (cCRT) with 60 Gy in 30 fractions is the standard of care for stage 111 non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). With a median overall survival of 28.7 months at best and maximum locoregional control rates of 70% at two years, the prognosis for these patients is still dismal. This systematic review summarizes data on dose escalation by alternative fractionation, which has been explored as a primary strategy to improve both local control and overall survival over the past three decades. A Pubmed literature search was performed according to the PRISMA guidelines. Because of the large variety of radiation regimens total doses were converted to EQD2,T . Only studies using an EQD2,T of at least 49.5 Gy, which corresponds to the conventional 60 Gy in six weeks, were included. In a total of 3256 patients, the median OS was 17 months (range 7.4-30 months). While OS was better for patients treated after the year 2000 (P = 0.003) or with a mandatory 18 F-FDG-PET-CT in the diagnostic work-up (P = 0.001), treatment sequence did not make a difference (P = 0.106). The most commonly reported toxicity was acute esophagitis (AE) with a median rate of 24% (range 0%-84%). AE increased at a rate of 0.5% per Gy increment in EQD2,T (P = 0.016). Dose escalation above the conventional 60 Gy using modified radiation fractionation schedules and shortened OTT yield similar mOS and LRC regardless of treatment sequence with a significant EQD2,T dependent increase in AE. KEY POINTS: Significant findings Modified radiation dose escalation sequentially combined with chemotherapy yields similar outcome as concomitant treatment. OS is better with the mandatory inclusion of FDG-PET-CT in the diagnostic work-up. The risk of acute esophagitis increases with higher EQD2,T . What this study adds Chemo-radiotherapy (CRT) with modified dose escalation regimens yields OS and LC rates in the range of standard therapy regardless of treatment sequence. This broadens the database of curative options in patients who are not eligible concomitant CRT.",0

A comprehensive literature search of PubMed was performed to identify studies on resected true ampullary cancers, published between January 2010 and December 2018. Data including the use of radiation, chemotherapy or chemoradiation and the outcomes were extracted. A total of 116 records were identified, of which 65 screened were selected. Finally, nine studies were included. Only two of the studies reported separately the outcomes of pancreatobiliary and intestinal subtypes. Patients in the selected studies were treated with a pancreaticoduodenectomy with negative margins. Patients treated with adjuvant therapy were more likely to be pT3-4 and have positive nodes; median survival ranged from 30 to 47 months. A significant benefit for adjuvant treatment was observed in four of the studies, restricted to patients at stage IIB or higher. Likewise, patients with positive nodes may have a longer median survival with adjuvant chemoradiation compared to observation. The present review suggests a benefit for adjuvant treatment for patients with locally advanced tumors. Randomized trials are needed to ascertain the topic, as well as studies reporting toxicity and quality of life of resected true ampullary cancer patients.",0

Objective To systematically review the prevalence of skin cancer and behaviors that increase risk of skin cancer among sexual and gender minority populations. Methods We performed a systematic literature review in PubMed/MEDLINE, Embase, Cochrane, and Web of Science, searching for articles through October 18, 2019, that investigated risk of skin cancer and behaviors among sexual and gender minority populations. Results Sexual minority men have a higher lifetime risk of any skin cancer (odds ratio range: 1.3-2.1) and indoor tanning bed use (odds ratio range: 2.8-5.9) compared with heterosexual men, whereas sexual minority women may use indoor tanning beds less frequently than heterosexual women and do not have an elevated risk of lifetime history of skin cancer. Gender-nonconforming individuals have higher lifetime prevalence of any skin cancer compared with cisgender men. Limitations Most variables rely on self-reporting in their original studies. Conclusions Sexual minority men disproportionately engage in use of indoor tanning beds, which may result in increased lifetime risk of skin cancer. Recognition of this risk is important for providing appropriate screening for patients in this population.",0
https://doi.org/10.1055/s-0040-1710592,Risk of Bleeding with Exposure to Warfarin and Nonsteroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drugs: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis,"Abstract Background Warfarin use can trigger the occurrence of bleeding independently or as a result of a drug–drug interaction when used in combination with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). Objectives This article examines the risk of bleeding in individuals exposed to concomitant warfarin and NSAID compared with those taking warfarin alone (Prospero Registry ID 145237). Methods PubMed, EMBASE, Scopus, and Web of Science were searched. The primary outcome of interest was gastrointestinal bleeding and general bleeding. Summary effects were calculated to estimate average treatment effect using random effects models. Heterogeneity was assessed using Cochran's Q and I 2. Risk of bias was also assessed using the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality bias assessment tool. Results A total of 651 studies were identified, of which 11 studies met inclusion criteria for meta-analysis. The odds ratio (OR) for gastrointestinal bleeding when exposed to warfarin and an NSAID was 1.98 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.55–2.53). The risk of gastrointestinal bleeding was also significantly elevated with exposure to a COX-2 inhibitor and warfarin relative to warfarin alone (OR = 1.90, 95% CI: 1.46–2.46). There was an increased risk of general bleeding with the combination of warfarin with NSAIDs (OR = 1.58, 95% CI: 1.18–2.12) or COX-2 inhibitors (OR = 1.54, 95% CI: 0.86–2.78) compared with warfarin alone. Conclusion Risk of bleeding is significantly increased among persons taking warfarin and a NSAID or COX-2 inhibitor together as compared with taking warfarin alone. It is important to caution patients about taking these medications in combination.",0

https://doi.org/10.1186/s12889-020-08649-x,The impact of health literacy environment on patient stress: a systematic review,"Abstract Background There exists little literature on situational health literacy - that is, how an individual’s health literacy varies across different health literacy environments. However, one can consider the role of stress when examining the relationship between health situations and decision-making ability, and by proxy health literacy. The aim of this study was to assess the strength of the evidence on the relationship between health situations and patient stress, considered in the context of health professional perception, and determine what health situations act to influence patient stress. Methods A systematic review of English articles using PubMed, PsycINFO, CINAHL and Embase databases was conducted. Search terms focused on ‘patient’, ‘stress’, and ‘health care situations’. Only peer-reviewed original research with data on patient stress in the context of a health facility environment was included. Studies were screened and critically appraised by both authors. Study elements for extraction were defined by RO and extracted by JY. Results Twenty-four studies were included for narrative synthesis. Patients in Intensive Care Units were more stressed about factors relating to their physical discomfort, with some agreement from health care professionals. Parents of children in Intensive Care Units were more concerned with stressors relating to their child’s appearance and behaviour, and alteration in their parental role. Few studies examined health settings other than Intensive Care Units, and those that did varied greatly in terms of study design and population characteristics, lacking generalisability. Conclusions Overall, the findings of what patients find most stressful in Intensive Care Units can guide health care professionals practicing best practice care. However, the evidence on how patient stress is influenced by non-Intensive Care Unit health care settings is weak. Further research is needed to enhance current understanding of the interaction between patient stress and health care environments in both hospital and primary care settings.",0

ACE scores have been used to associate childhood adversity to a wide range of adverse health conditions over the life course, most notably substance-related disorders. Multiple studies have shown that the presence of elevated ACE scores predicts obesity in adulthood. However, a gap exists in the literature elucidating the pathways from childhood adversity to increased BMI in adulthood. We systematically reviewed these mechanisms as well as discuss novel plausible pathways. We searched PubMed, PsycInfo, Embase, and Web of Science and after applying exclusion criteria identified 18 articles for qualitative analysis. The most commonly cited mechanisms linking ACEs to obesity are social disruption, health behaviors, and chronic stress response. Ten observational studies (n=118,691) were quantitatively summarized and demonstrated a positive association between ACE and adult obesity with a pooled odds ratio of 1.46 (CI=1.28, 1.64) with moderate heterogeneity (I2=70.8%). Our results found a 46% increase in the odds of adult obesity following exposure to multiple ACEs. Based on our qualitative synthesis and review of the most recent relevant literature, we propose biologically plausible explanations for the significant positive relationship between ACEs and adult obesity. Reducing exposure to ACEs, improved screening and detection of trauma, better access to trauma-informed care, and improvements to the food environment are likely to improve downstream health outcomes related to eating behavior.",0

The knowledge gained from previous human coronavirus outbreaks suggests that pregnant women and their fetuses are particularly susceptible to poor outcomes. The objective of this study was to summarize the clinical manifestations and maternal and perinatal outcomes of COVID-19 during pregnancy.We searched databases for all case reports and series from 12 February to 4 April 2020. Multiple terms and combinations were used including COVID-19, pregnancy, maternal mortality, maternal morbidity, complications, clinical manifestations, neonatal morbidity, intrauterine fetal death, neonatal mortality and SARS-CoV-2. Eligibility criteria included peer-reviewed publications written in English or Chinese and quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) or dual fluorescence PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection. Unpublished reports, unspecified date and location of the study or suspicion of duplicate reporting, cases with suspected COVID-19 that were not confirmed by a laboratory test, and unreported maternal or perinatal outcomes were excluded. Data on clinical manifestations, maternal and perinatal outcomes including vertical transmission were extracted and analyzed.Eighteen articles reporting data from 108 pregnancies between 8 December 2019 and 1 April 2020 were included in the current study. Most reports described women presenting in the third trimester with fever (68%) and coughing (34%). Lymphocytopenia (59%) with elevated C-reactive protein (70%) was observed and 91% of the women were delivered by cesarean section. Three maternal intensive care unit admissions were noted but no maternal deaths. One neonatal death and one intrauterine death were also reported.Although the majority of mothers were discharged without any major complications, severe maternal morbidity as a result of COVID-19 and perinatal deaths were reported. Vertical transmission of the COVID-19 could not be ruled out. Careful monitoring of pregnancies with COVID-19 and measures to prevent neonatal infection are warranted.",0

However, treatment modality is still not reported systematically. The current study aimed to conduct a systematic review of the treatment modality of PEIR case reports and to report a case on the preservation of a vital pulp with surgical exposure in permanent maxillary canine.We systematically searched case reports from PubMed/MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Web of science databases. The treatment modality, suspected etiology, and follow up periods were collected from each study and reviewed by two authors independently.The initial search identified 100 studies. After the title/abstract screening, 37 articles received a full-text reading; and finally, 24 articles (29 patients and 37 affected teeth) were selected for the final review. Among the 24 unerupted teeth, surgical opening and restoration treatment of PEIR was chosen as a high priority for treatment options (n = 9, 36%). Among the 13 erupted teeth, restoration was applied for the prevention such as developing in size and fracture (n = 4, 31%).According to this systematic review, treatment modalities were based on the progressive nature of the lesion size and eruption state to establish the optimal approach for each patient. Clinicians should take into account the eruption status, lesion progression, the size of the lesion, and the degree of pulp involvement.",0

Reflecting the building momentum of PT use worldwide, construction has recently commenced for The Australian Bragg Centre for Proton Therapy and Research in Adelaide - the first PT centre in Australia. This systematic review aims to update the clinical evidence base for PT, both proton beam and carbon ion therapy. The purpose is to inform clinical decision-making for referral of patients to PT centres in Australia as they become operational and overseas in the interim. Three major databases were searched by two independent researchers, and evidence quality was classified according to the National Health and Medical Research Council evidence hierarchy. One hundred and thirty-six studies were included, two-thirds related to proton beam therapy alone. PT at the very least provides equivalent tumour outcomes compared to photon controls with the possibility of improved control in the case of carbon ion therapy. There is suggestion of reduced morbidities in a range of tumour sites, supporting the predictions from dosimetric modelling and the wide international acceptance of PT for specific indications based on this. Though promising, this needs to be counterbalanced by the overall low quality of evidence found, with 90% of studies of level IV (case series) evidence. Prospective comparative clinical trials, supplemented by database-derived outcome information, preferably conducted within international and national networks, are strongly recommended as PT is introduced into Australasia.",0

However, the long-term oncological outcomes of robot mesorectal excision require further investigation.The PubMed, EMBASE, Medline, and Cochrane Library databases were searched from the date of database inception to March 31, 2019 for all available trials; the results of robotic and laparoscopic mesorectal excision for rectal cancer surgery were compared. Survival parameters, including overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS), were independently extracted by two investigators. Hazard ratios (HRs) were calculated using random- or fixed-effects models. The presence of heterogeneity was assessed using Q test, and the extent of heterogeneity was quantified by I2 index. The meta-analysis was performed using Review Manager software, version 5.3.A total of seven studies including 2593 patients (1362 treated by robotic mesorectal excision and 1231 by laparoscopic mesorectal excision) were included. Pooled analyses showed no significant difference in OS (HR = 0.94, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.63 to 1.39, P = 0.75) or DFS (HR = 0.93, 95% CI: 0.79 to 1.10, P = 0.85) between the robotic and laparoscopic mesorectal excision for treatment of rectal cancer.Regarding long-term survival, robotic mesorectal excision for rectal cancer is comparable to laparoscopic mesorectal excision. More prospective, multicenter randomized trials with longer follow-up periods are needed to determine the long-term outcomes of patients undergoing robotic mesorectal excision.",0

However, there are limited data about the other pesticide groups, especially in Europe.Based on a systematic review, we aimed to assess the influence of neuro- and thyrotoxic agricultural and domestic pesticides (other than OPs, OCs, pyrethroids and carbamates) authorized in Europe on risk of ASD in children or ASD behavioral phenotypes in rodents.Pesticides were initially identified in the Hazardous Substances Data Bank. 20 currently used (10 pesticide groups) were retained based on the higher exposure potential. Epidemiological (children) and in vivo (rodents) studies were identified through PubMed, Web of Science and TOXLINE, without restriction of publication date or country (last update: November 2019). The risk of bias and level of evidence were also assessed. This systematic review is registered at the International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews (PROSPERO, registration number CRD42019145384).In total, two epidemiological and 15 in vivo studies were retained, focusing on the azole, neonicotinoid, phenylpyrazole and phosphonoglycine pesticide groups. No study was conducted in Europe. Glyphosate, imidacloprid, clothianidin, myclobutanil, acetamiprid, tebuconazole, thiabendazole and fipronil, globally reported an association with an increased risk of ASD in children and/or ASD behavioral phenotypes in rodents. In children, glyphosate and myclobutanil showed a ""moderate level of evidence"" in their association with ASD, whereas imidacloprid showed an ""inadequate level of evidence"". In rodents, clothianidin, imidacloprid and glyphosate showed a ""high level of evidence"" in their association with altered behavioral, learning and memory skills.In the framework of environmental risk factors of ASD, novel hypotheses can be formulated about early exposure to eight pesticides. Glyphosate presented the most salient level of evidence. Given their neuro- and thyrotoxic properties, additional studies are needed for the 12 other pesticides not yet studied as potential ASD risk factors according to our inclusion criteria.",1

The aim of this study is to evaluate the clinical and surgical-pathological features, prognosis, treatment options, and survival of primary CLMS.A systematic review of the medical literature was conducted to evaluate articles about primary CLMS. The literature was searched between 1959 and May 2019. On final evaluation, there were 29 articles (one consisted of 8 cases; one consisted of 3 cases) and 42 cases with the addition of our 4 cases.Age (⩾48 versus ⩽47 years) (hazard ratio.HR], 4.528; 95% confidence interval.CI], 1.550-13.227; p=0.006) and mitoses count (<10/10 high-power field [HPF] versus ⩾10/10 HPF) (HR, 3.865; 95% CI, 1.046-14.278; p=0.043) are independent prognostic factors for recurrence and age (HR, 5.318; 95% CI, 1.671-16.920; p=0.005) and hysterectomy (performed versus not performed) (HR, 4.377; 95% CI, 1.341-14.283; p=0.014) are independent prognostic factors for death because of disease on multivariate analysis.Information on primary CLMS is sparse and obtained from rare case reports and case series. Hysterectomy must be the first choice of treatment in these patients according to our results on multivariate analysis. The type of hysterectomy does not have an effect on oncologic outcome. Radical hysterectomy is not obligatory and more data are needed to make more accurate conclusions.",0

The shortage of surgical care providers at this district and rural level can be met by surgical task-shifting/sharing to non-physician clinicians (NPCs) and non-specialist physicians (NSPs). While the role of NPCs in low–middle-income countries (LMICs), in particular in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA), has been well documented in the literature, there has been little focus on NSPs. In addition to providing essential surgical services, this physician cadre also practices generalist medicine, an advantage at the first-level hospital. The present study seeks to explore where, across all country income groups, NSPs are providing surgical services and what additional surgical training, if any, is available in each identified country. A systematic review of the literature was performed, following PRISMA guidelines. Medline, EMBASE, EBM Reviews, and CINAHL were searched. Including hand-searching for further references, 53 publications met inclusion/exclusion criteria and were identified for data extraction purposes. Gray literature was also explored within the time limits for this study. Surgical task-shifting/sharing to NSPs occurs across all country income groups; some provide surgical obstetrics, while others also provide a broader scope of surgical services. Within LMIC countries, the majority are in SSA. In SSA, 16 of 54 countries were included in the reviewed articles, only 4 of which (Ethiopia, Niger, Nigeria, and Sierra Leone) have a formal surgical program beyond the regular medical officer/general practitioner training. Canada and Australia have established programs for both surgical obstetrics and the broader scope, while the USA has several programs for surgical obstetrics and is developing a new, broad-scope program. This study has demonstrated that NSPs are providing surgical services across all income groups, with varying degrees of additional training specific to the surgical needs of their district/rural location. To “close the gap” in needed surgical services at the first-level hospital, more task-sharing needs to occur to both NSPs (the focus of this study) and NPCs. Collaboration between practitioners and training programs, given the shared challenges and practice environments, would help support task-sharing at the first-level hospital and improve access to the 5 billion underserved people.",0
https://doi.org/10.1111/jgh.15010,Systematic review of hepatic arterial infusion chemotherapy <i>versus</i> sorafenib in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma with portal vein tumor thrombosis,"The prognosis of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) with portal vein tumor thrombosis (PVTT) is very poor. This study aimed to evaluate hepatic arterial infusion chemotherapy (HAIC) versus sorafenib (SORF) in the treatment of HCC with PVTT.Studies were identified online in Embase and MEDLINE before October 31, 2019. The end-points were overall survival (OS), progression-free survival (PFS), disease control rate (DCR), and safety.Six studies with 417 cases were included in this systematic review. Meta-analyses demonstrated that HAIC is superior to SORF with respect to OS (hazard ratio [HR]: 0.50, 95% confidence interval: 0.38-0.66, P < 0.001) and PFS (HR: 0.47, 95% confidence interval: 0.31-0.73, P = 0.001) irrespective of research territoriality and study quality. Our systematic review also demonstrated that HAIC is superior to SORF with respect to DCR. Subgroup analysis demonstrated that the advantage is more obvious in the treatment of types III-IV PVTT with respect to OS (HR: 0.29, P < 0.001) and PFS(HR: 0.39, P < 0.001). HAIC caused more grades 3-4 neutropenia (HR: 10.71), anemia (HR: 7.55), leukopenia (HR: 10.38), and thrombocytopenia (HR: 13.09) than SORF. However, HAIC caused fewer cases of grades 3-4 aspartate aminotransferase rising (HR: 0.21), diarrhea (HR: 0.14), and hand-foot syndrome (HR: 0.14) than SORF.This systematic review demonstrated that HAIC is superior to SORF in HCC with PVTT with respect to OS, PFS, and DCR, especially in HCC with types III-IV PVTT. HAIC caused more myelosuppression, whereas SORF is associated with diarrhea and hand-foot syndrome. Further randomized controlled trials are warranted.",0

The use of complementary and alternative medicine therapies to assist with sleep has been studied but given the variety of modalities and methodological limitations no reliable conclusions have been drawn.To synthesise research findings regarding the effectiveness of using complementary and alternative medicine interventions within the domains of mind and body practices (relaxation techniques, acupuncture) and natural biologically based products (herbs, vitamins, minerals, probiotics) on sleep quality and quantity in adult intensive care patients.Systematic review.Five databases were searched in August 2018 and updated in February 2019 and 2020.Searches were limited to peer reviewed randomised controlled trials, published in English involving adult populations in intensive care units. Interventions were related to the complementary and alternative medicine domains of mind and body practices and natural products. Included studies were assessed using Cochrane's risk of bias tool.Seventeen studies were included. The interventions used varied: 4 investigated melatonin; 4 music +/- another therapy; 3 acupressure; 2 aromatherapy and 1 each for relaxation and imagery, reflexology, bright light exposure and inspiratory muscle training. Measurement of sleep quantity and quality was also varied: 5 studies used objective measures such as Polysomnography and Bispectral index with the remaining using subjective patient or clinician assessment (for example, Richards-Campbell Sleep Questionnaire, Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index, observation). Given the different interventions, outcomes and measures used in the studies a meta-analysis was not possible. Generally, the results support the use of complementary and alternative medicine for assisting with sleep with 11 out of 17 trials reporting significant results for the interventions examined.Complementary and alternative medicine interventions, in particular, melatonin and music, have shown promise for improving sleep in adults with critical conditions; however, further research that addresses the limitations of small sample sizes and improved techniques for measuring sleep is needed.",0

However, quantitative research has suggested that these areas can be adversely affected by multiple chemical sensitivity (MCS). This systematic review therefore sought to explore what qualitative research has suggested about how people with MCS perceive it to affect their social and occupational functioning.Journal articles were included if they were 1) peer reviewed 2) qualitative or mixed methods 3) published in English 4) reported qualitative findings relevant to the review. Studies were excluded if they were 1) descriptive only 2) primarily concerned with environmental intolerances other than chemicals or 3) focussed on specific populations such as veterans. Quality was assessed using the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE, 2018) qualitative quality criteria. However, quality was not used to determine eligibility for inclusion. Six databases (CINAHL, Medline, PsychArticles, PsychInfo, Scopus and Web of Science) were searched between the 24th of February 2019 and 2nd of March 2019.Having removed duplicates, database searches identified 388 potential articles. Thirteen of these articles were eligible for inclusion. Following review, no more articles were included from the reference lists of these studies. Meta-aggregation of the findings identified seven categories. These were synthesised into three themes; 'limited access', 'loss & anxiety' and 'seeking engagement'.The findings suggested that MCS limits some people's social and occupational functioning. The results warrant further research, and, the development of prevention and intervention strategies.

Twin studies have investigated the aetiology of these covariations. However, to our knowledge, no systematic review examining the covariation between these conditions has been conducted. We searched the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, EMBASE, MEDLINE, and PsychInfo for twin studies examining the covariation between pain with depression and/or anxiety published from inception to May 16, 2019. Included studies reported: original data on twin samples using the classical twin or co-twin control designs; investigated the association between pain and depression and/or anxiety; were published in peer-reviewed journals; used validated measures; included ≥100 twin pairs. Of 359 retrieved articles, 23 met our inclusion criteria. Most studies found that the covariation of pain with depression and/or anxiety was explained by genetic (n = 6) or both genetic and environmental (n = 16) factors. Most studies were cross-sectional, and all were led in adult populations. Future research requires the use of more standardized measurement tools, including quantitative sensory testing as well as assess child-adolescent cohorts.",0

To evaluate the relationship between different kinds of index-based dietary patterns and gastric cancer risk, we systematically searched four English-language databases and four Chinese-language databases. The quality of studies was assessed by the Newcastle–Ottawa Scale. Meta-analyses were performed to estimate the association between gastric cancer incidence and different types of index-based dietary patterns. The OR and hazard ratios (HR) of gastric cancer incidence were calculated by regression models in case–control studies and prospective cohort studies, respectively. The studies were pooled in the random effects model to calculate the summarised risk estimate of the highest quantile interval of dietary indices, taking the lowest as the referent. The dietary indices included different versions of Mediterranean diet score (MDS) and dietary inflammatory index (DII), healthy eating index, Chinese Food Pagoda score and food index score. The meta-analysis was carried out for studies on MDS and DII. The combined OR of gastric cancer for the highest MDS v. the referent was 0·42 (95 % CI 0·2, 0·86), and the combined HR was 0·89 (95 % CI 0·68, 1·17). The combined OR for DII was 2·11 (95 % CI 1·41, 3·15). Higher Mediterranean dietary pattern consumption might reduce gastric cancer risk, while higher inflammatory diet pattern consumption might increase gastric cancer risk.",1

This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to evaluate whether computed tomography (CT) scan indexes of muscle mass quantity and quality could be used as prognostic factors in ovarian cancer. Methods Three electronic bibliographic databases (MEDLINE, Web of Science, and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials) were used to conduct a systematic literature search from inception to January 2020. The primary outcome was overall survival. Pooled analyses of hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were performed with Review Manager 5.3. Heterogeneity was assessed by measuring inconsistency (I 2 based on the χ 2 test). Secondary outcomes included progression free survival, disease free survival, postoperative complications, and chemotoxicity. Study quality and quality of evidence were assessed. Results A total of 15 studies were included in the systematic review, of which six studies (1226 patients) were included in the meta-analysis. Summary unadjusted HRs (HR 1.11, 95% CI 0.84 to 1.46, p=0.47) and adjusted HRs (HR 1.10, 95% CI 0.84 to 1.43, p=0.49) did not show a significant association between low skeletal muscle index and overall survival (p&gt;0.05) in ovarian cancer. Instead, although the quality of evidence was low, pooled data of three studies, comprising 679 patients, showed a significant association between low skeletal muscle radiodensity and poor overall survival (HR 1.63, 95% CI 1.28 to 2.07, p&lt;0.0001). Moreover, the heterogeneity between studies precluded the possibility of performing a meta-analysis and reaching conclusions for progression free survival, disease free survival, surgical complications, and chemotoxicity. Conclusions This work suggested that the measurement of skeletal muscle radiodensity by routine CT scan at diagnosis, with standardization of diagnostic criteria, could be a reliable tool to select at risk patients and to individualize effective nutritional strategies. However, prospective homogeneous studies with a larger number of patients are required to confirm these results.",0

However, epidemiological studies focusing on the relationship between helminth infections and risk of allergic diseases, performed worldwide, show inconsistent findings. Previous systematic reviews of observational studies published 10 or more years ago showed conflicting findings for effects of helminths on allergic diseases. Over the past 10 years there has been growing literature addressing this research area and these need to be considered in order to appreciate the most contemporary evidence. The objective of the current systematic review will be to provide an up-to-date synthesis of findings of observational studies investigating the influence of helminth infections on atopy, and allergic diseases.

Endocrine-disrupting compounds (EDCs) have become omnipresent in our environment. Individuals may or may not experience clinical health issues from being exposed to the increasing environmental pollution in daily life, but an issue of high concern is that also the non-exposed progeny may encounter consequences of these ancestral exposures. Progress in understanding epigenetic mechanisms opens new perspectives to estimate the risk of man-made EDCs. However, the field of epigenetic toxicology is new and its application in public health or in the understanding of disease etiology is almost non-existent, especially if it concerns future generations. In this review, we investigate the literature on transgenerational inheritance of diseases, published in the past 10 years. We question whether persistent epigenetic changes occur in the male germ line after exposure to synthesized EDCs. Our systematic search led to an inclusion of 43 articles, exploring the effects of commonly used synthetic EDCs, such as plasticizers (phthalates and bisphenol A), pesticides (dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane, atrazine, vinclozin, methoxychlor), dioxins, and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs, such as benzo(a)pyrene). Most studies found transgenerational epigenetic effects, often linked to puberty- or adult-onset diseases, such as testicular or prostate abnormalities, metabolic disorders, behavioral anomalies, and tumor development. The affected epigenetic mechanisms included changes in DNA methylation patterns, transcriptome, and expression of DNA methyltransferases. Studies involved experiments in animal models and none were based on human data. In the future, human studies are needed to confirm animal findings. If not transgenerational, at least intergenerational human studies and studies on EDC-induced epigenetic effects on germ cells could help to understand early processes of inheritance. Next, toxicity tests of new chemicals need a more comprehensive approach before they are introduced on the market. We further point to the relevance of epigenetic toxicity tests in regard to public health of the current population but also of future generations. Finally, this review sheds a light on how the interplay of genetics and epigenetics may explain the current knowledge gap on transgenerational inheritance.",1
https://doi.org/10.1017/s003329172000094x,Perceived ethnic discrimination as a risk factor for psychotic symptoms: a systematic review and meta-analysis,"Abstract Background Previous studies have shown an elevated risk of psychotic symptoms (PS) and experiences (PEs) among ethnic minority groups, with significant variation between groups. This pattern may be partially attributable to the unfavorable socio-environmental conditions that surround ethnic minority groups. Perceived ethnic discrimination (PED) in particular has been a salient putative risk factor to explain the increased risk. Methods We conducted a systematic literature review and meta-analysis to assess the impact of PED on reporting PS/PEs in ethnic minorities. This review abides by the guidelines set forth by Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses. The included studies were obtained from the databases: Medline, PsycINFO, and Web Of Science. Sub-group analyses were performed assessing the effect of PED in different subtypes of PS, the influence of ethnicity and moderating/mediating factors. Results Seventeen studies met the inclusion criteria, and nine were used to conduct the meta-analysis. We found a positive association between PED and the occurrence of PS/PEs among ethnic minorities. The combined odds ratio were 1.77 (95% CI 1.26–2.49) for PS and 1.94 (95% CI 1.42–2.67) for PEs. We found that the association was similar across ethnic groups and did not depend on the ethnic origin of individuals. Weak evidence supported the buffering effects of ethnic identity, collective self-esteem and social support; and no evidence supported the moderating effect of ethnic density. Sensitivity to race-based rejection significantly but only slightly mediated the association. Conclusion These findings suggest that PED is involved in the increased risk of PS/PEs in ethnic minority populations.",0

While there is a large literature on mental health, the effects of armed conflict on children's physical health and development are not well understood. This systematic review summarizes the current and past knowledge on the effects of armed conflict on child health and development.A systematic review was performed with searches in major and regional databases for papers published 1 January 1945 to 25 April 2017. Included studies provided data on physical and/or developmental outcomes associated with armed conflict in children under 18 years. Data were extracted on health outcomes, displacement, social isolation, experience of violence, orphan status, and access to basic needs. The review is registered with PROSPERO: CRD42017036425.Among 17,679 publications screened, 155 were eligible for inclusion. Nearly half of the 131 quantitative studies were case reports, chart or registry reviews, and one-third were cross-sectional studies. Additionally, 18 qualitative and 6 mixed-methods studies were included. The papers describe mortality, injuries, illnesses, environmental exposures, limitations in access to health care and education, and the experience of violence, including torture and sexual violence. Studies also described conflict-related social changes affecting child health. The geographical coverage of the literature is limited. Data on the effects of conflict on child development are scarce.The available data document the pervasive effect of conflict as a form of violence against children and a negative social determinant of child health. There is an urgent need for research on the mechanisms by which conflict affects child health and development and the relationship between physical health, mental health, and social conditions. Particular priority should be given to studies on child development, the long term effects of exposure to conflict, and protective and mitigating factors against the harmful effects of armed conflict on children.",0

The associations of air pollution and rheumatoid arthritis (RA) are controversial. This systematic review and meta-analyses has analyzed the association between outdoor air pollution and the development of RA. Methods PubMed, Embase and Web of science (last search, May 21, 2019) were searched. A meta-analysis was performed with a random-effects model, and summarized syntheses effects were expressed as relative risks (RRs). Results Eight studies were identified from among 1296 articles. The pooled RR for the association between ozone (O3) exposure and RA was 1.16 (95% CI: 1.15, 1.18). The pooled RR for the association of RA risk with proximity to traffic road was 1.34 (95% CI: 1.11, 1.62) for residence ≤ 50 m from a traffic road compared with residence more far away. In contrast, there was an inverse effect between PM2.5 exposure and incident RA, and similar result of PM10 was found by subgroup analysis in seropositive RA. In addition, there was no clear evidence between exposing to PM10, CO, NO2 and NO2 (tenth year prior) and RA risk. Conclusion Existing evidence indicated significant associations between some markers (ozone, proximity to traffic road and PM2.5) of air pollution and RA. For generalizability of evidence, that research should be extended to developing countries where air pollution (including indoor) is high may provide more complete insight into risk factors for RA.",1

The aim of the present study was to review previous epidemiological studies that examined the relationship between BPA exposure and the risk of obesity. PubMed, Web of Science, and Embase databases were systematically searched by 2 independent investigators for articles published from the start of database coverage until January 1, 2020. Subsequently, the reference list of each relevant article was scanned for any other potentially eligible publications. We included observational studies published in English that measured urinary BPA. Odds ratios with corresponding 95% confidence intervals for the highest versus lowest level of BPA were calculated. Ten studies with a sample size from 888 to 4793 participants met our inclusion criteria. We found a positive correlation between the level of BPA and obesity risk. A dose–response analysis revealed that 1-ng/mL increase in BPA increased the risk of obesity by 11%. The similar results were for different type of obesity, gender, and age.",1

Objective This systematic review and meta-analyses aim to assess the impact of delays in radical cystectomy. Evidence acquisition A systematic review was conducted by searching Medline and Ovid Gateway using protocol-driven search terms in August 2019, with no time limit on the studies included. The identified studies were assessed according to strict criteria and using the Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology (STROBE) checklist and Risk of Bias in Non-randomised Studies—of Interventions (ROBINS-I) tool. Meta-analyses were conducted based on the type of delay. Random-effect models were used whereby the presence of a delay was the exposure variable and overall survival was the outcome of interest, for which pooled hazard ratios were calculated. Evidence synthesis Nineteen studies were eligible for inclusion (17 532 patients), of which 10 were included in the meta-analyses. A longer delay between bladder cancer diagnosis and radical cystectomy resulted in a pooled hazard ratio of 1.34 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.18–1.53) for overall death. For a delay between transurethral resection and cystectomy, we found a pooled hazard ratio of 1.18 (95% CI: 0.99–1.41) for overall death. A pooled hazard ratio of 1.04 (95% CI: 0.93–1.16) was calculated for a longer delay between neoadjuvant chemotherapy and radical cystectomy. Conclusions A delay in radical cystectomy after diagnosis was found to have a significantly detrimental effect on overall survival for bladder cancer patients. However, there was huge heterogeneity in how a delay was defined. Patient summary In this review, we investigated the effect of a delay in radical treatment on survival. This review highlights the importance of scheduling radical cystectomies in a timely manner whilst monitoring factors such as comorbidities and scheduling, in order to treat patients requiring radical cystectomy without delay.",0
https://doi.org/10.1111/bcp.14246,A systematic review and combined meta‐analysis of concentration of oral amisulpride,"Aims Amisulpride, a first-line schizophrenia treatment, has shown large interindividual variability in plasma/serum levels, often outside the reference range (100-320 ng/mL). This study aims to clarify the impact of dose, sex, age and related factors for the interpatient variability in amisulpride plasma/serum concentration. Methods Both English and Chinese databases were searched from their inception to May 16, 2019, using the terms: amisulpride and (plasma OR serum OR blood OR monitoring OR concentration). Studies reporting concentrations and either a dose, associated factor, clinical outcome or side effect were included. Results Fourteen studies with 1628 participants were eventually included. Eligible articles yielded data on drug concentration and dose, averaging 333.9 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 294.5-373.3) ng/mL and 636.2 (95% CI: 549.7-722.6) mg/d, respectively. The calculated mean concentration-to-dose (C/D) ratio was 0.60 (95% CI: 0.52-0.67) (ng/mL)/mg. Subgroup analysis suggested that female patients on combined lithium-amisulpride have higher concentration levels and C/D ratios. Age was slight positive associated with C/D ratio while not for plasma level. Smoker patients have high concentration level than nonsmoking patients but not for C/D. Responsive and nonresponsive groups did not differ in concentration and C/D. Conclusion Pooled concentration levels of amisulpride were higher than recommended with wide individual variation, especially in older patients, female patients and patients taking amisulpride combined with lithium. The specific therapeutic reference range for amisulpride may require reconstruction, which should consider the influence of age, sex, kidney function, drug-drug interactions, different dose regimens and sampling times in future study.",0

Studies published in English examining survival in patients with multiple melanomas were included. Case studies and small case series were excluded. Results There were 14 studies eligible for inclusion. Conclusions on survival varied markedly depending on the statistical method used. Four studies that accounted for survival bias by partitioning the survival time were included in the quantitative review, with 3 of these reporting a survival disadvantage for MPM, whereas the fourth showed no difference in survival. The pooled hazard ratio was 1.39 (95% confidence interval, 1.07-1.81) but with significant heterogeneity (I2 = 96.8%, Phet  Limitations Studies showed significant heterogeneity in methodology. Conclusion When data were analyzed with robust statistical methods, patients with MPM had a survival disadvantage compared with patients with a single primary melanoma.",0

A systematic review and meta-analysis,"Abstract Background To evaluate whether oral lichen planus (OLP) is a risk factor for peri-implant diseases (PIDs) with a systematic review and meta-analysis. Methods Five electronic databases including Medline, Embase, Web of Science, the Cochrane Library and Scopus were searched. The included studies are observational human studies written in English. The population of interest included those with/without OLP who received dental implant treatment. The follow-up time after implantation was from 1 month to 20 years. The quality of the included articles regarding risk of bias and methodology were assessed with the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale or the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality. The data involving exposure (OLP), primary outcomes (implants having PIDs) and secondary outcomes (probing depth/PD, bleeding on probing/BOP and bone loss/BL) and potential confounders were extracted. Heterogeneity was assessed by I 2 test. Dichotomous data are expressed as the risk ratio (RR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) which were calculated with a fixed effect model. Results Of the 66 articles, two studies were enrolled and evaluated as high quality, which totally contained 68 participants receiving 222 (OLP vs. non-OLP, 112 vs. 110) implants with 12 to 120-month follow-up time. Proportions of implants with PIDs between OLP and non-OLP groups were as follows: 19.6% (22/112) vs. 22.7% (25/110) for PIM and 17.0% (19/112) vs. 10.9% (12/110) for PI. The meta-analysis revealed no recognizable difference in number of implants with PIDs (PI: RR = 1.49, 95% CI 0.77–2.90, P = 0.24; PIM:RR = 0.88, 95% CI 0.53–1.46, P = 0.61; PIDs: RR = 1.08, 95% CI 0.75–1.55, P = 0.68) or BOP (RR = 0.90, 95% CI: 0.70–1.15, P = 0.40) between OLP and non-OLP groups. Conclusions Available articles regarding the effects of OLP on PIDs remains very limited. Existing evidence does not support OLP as a suspected risk factor for PIDs. Large-scale prospective trials are required to validate the findings.",0
https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph17062091,The Effects of Short-Term and Long-term Hearing Changes on Music Exposure: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis,"The present study explores the scientific evidence on whether music exposure temporarily or permanently affects hearing sensitivity in young adults. Six electronic databases were searched using related keywords for the four categories of personal listening devices, listening habits, hearing outcomes, and age. The Hedges’ g and its 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were estimated. A Higgins I2 was also used to check for heterogeneity. To test for publication bias, funnel plots were drawn using Egger’s regression. Based on the inclusion criteria, 16 studies were divided into two groups to identify short-term hearing changes (n = 7) and long-term hearing changes (n = 9). In the short term, there was no significant immediate change in the thresholds or amplitudes after the music exposure, although pure-tone thresholds (PTAs) and distortion product otoacoustic emissions (DPOAEs) did show the highest effect size (−0.344, CI −0.727 to 0.038) and (0.124, CI −0.047 to 0.296) at 4 kHz. On the other hand, for long-term hearing changes, the PTA provided the highest effect size at 6 kHz (−0.525, CI −0.897 to −0.154) and 8 kHz (–0.486, CI −0.819 to −0.152), while also implying that habitual and repeated personal listening device (PLD) usage can act on some significant hearing changes in audiological tests. We conclude that the use of a PLD produces a few temporary hearing changes at 4 kHz after its use but that the changes are then reversed. However, it is important to note heavy PLD users’ experience regarding permanent changes in their hearing thresholds at high frequencies, and the public should be educated on this issue.",0
https://doi.org/10.1007/s12550-019-00384-6,Maternal mycotoxin exposure and adverse pregnancy outcomes: a systematic review,"Abstract Mycotoxin exposure from food occurs globally but is more common in hot humid environments, especially in low-income settings, and might affect pregnancy outcomes. This study aimed to synthesize the evidence from epidemiological studies on the relationship between maternal or fetal exposure to different mycotoxins and the occurrence of adverse pregnancy outcomes. Multiple databases were systematically searched up to December 2018 to identify studies that assessed the association between mycotoxin exposure in pregnant women or fetuses and at least one pregnancy outcome. Studies were appraised and results were synthesized using standard methods for conducting systematic reviews. This review identified and included 17 relevant studies. There is some evidence to suggest that exposure to various Aspergillus mycotoxins (e.g., aflatoxin) during pregnancy may impair intrauterine fetal growth and promote neonatal jaundice. Findings were inconclusive concerning the influence of aflatoxin exposure on perinatal death and preterm birth. Only two studies assessed effects of maternal exposure to Fusarium mycotoxins (e.g., fumonisin) on adverse pregnancy outcomes. These studies found that maternal fumonisin exposure may be associated with hypertensive emergencies in pregnancy and with neural tube defects. Studies using grain farming and weather conditions as a proxy measure for mycotoxin exposure found that such exposure was associated with an increased risk of preterm birth and late-term miscarriage. In conclusion, there is already some evidence to suggest that exposure to mycotoxins during pregnancy may have detrimental effects on pregnancy outcomes. However, given the limited number of studies, especially on effects of Fusarium mycotoxins, more studies are needed for a more comprehensive understanding of the effects of different mycotoxins on maternal and fetal health and to guide public health policies and interventions.",1

We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis to evaluate progression of elderly onset (EO) IBD in population-based cohorts and compared it with adult onset (AO) IBD. Methods In a systematic review through June 1, 2019, we identified population-based cohort studies of EO IBD reporting the cumulative risk of hospitalization, surgery, mortality, treatment patterns, escalation, and/or malignancy. Data were synthesized using random-effects meta-analysis as cumulative risk of events at 1 year, 5 years, and 10 years, and compared with data from patients with AO IBD in the same cohorts. Results We identified 9 studies, comprising 14,765 patients with EO IBD. In patients with EO Crohn’s disease (CD), the cumulative 5-year risk of surgery was 22.6% (95% CI, 18.7–27.2) and was similar to that of patients with AO CD (relative risk [RR], 1.04; 95% CI, 0.80–1.34). Overall exposure to corticosteroids was comparable between patients with EO CD vs AO CD (5-year risk: 55.4%; 95% CI, 53.4–57.4; RR, 0.88; 95% CI, 0.78–1.00), but exposure to immunomodulators (31.5%; 95% CI, 29.7–33.4; RR, 0.62; 95% CI, 0.51–0.77) or biologic agents (6.5%; 95% CI, 5.6–7.6; RR, 0.36; 95% CI, 0.25–0.52) was significantly lower for patients with EO CD than for patients with AO CD. Similarly, in patients with EO ulcerative colitis (UC), the cumulative 5-year risk of surgery was 7.8% (95% CI, 5.0–12.0), similar to the risk for patients with AO UC (RR, 1.29; 95% CI, 0.79–2.11). Overall exposure to corticosteroids was comparable between patients with EO UC vs AO UC (5-year risk: 57.2%; 95% CI, 55.6–58.7; RR, 0.98; 95% CI, 0.91–1.06), but exposure to immunomodulators (16.1%; 95% CI, 15.0–17.2; RR, 0.58; 95% CI, 0.54–0.62) or biologic agents (2.0%; 95% CI, 1.6–2.5; RR, 0.36; 95% CI, 0.24–0.52) was significantly lower for patients with EO UC than for patients with AO UC. Patients with EO IBD appeared to have increased mortality, but not malignancy, compared with the general population. There were few data on comorbidities or adverse effects of medications. Conclusions In a systematic review and meta-analysis, we found that patients with EO IBD have a similar risk of surgery as patients with AO IBD. However, patients with EO IBD are less likely to receive treatment with immunomodulators or biologic agents.",0
https://doi.org/10.1097/ajp.0000000000000808,A Systematic Review of Clinical Practice Guidelines for Acute Procedural Pain on Neonates,"Objectives During hospitalization in neonatal intensive care units, neonates are exposed to many painful procedures within a stressful environment. To date, many evidence-based guidelines are available. However, the quality of these guidelines and their clinical application remain unclear. This systematic review aimed to determinie the quality of existing guidelines on the management of procedural pain in neonates and to summarize the recommendations provided by these guidelines. Materials and methods A structured search was conducted in Embase, PubMed, CINAHL, JBI database, and gray literature resources in November 2018 to identify relevant guidelines published from 2007 onward. Published guidelines and guidelines from complementary searches were included in the treating assessment or management of procedural pain in neonates. The methodological quality was analyzed using the Appraisal of Guidelines for Research and Evaluation (AGREE) II Instrument. Results A total of 1154 records were identified. After screening for eligibility, 17 guidelines were included in this review. Among these, 11 were identified to be high-quality guidelines. Besides the usual recommendations for pharmacological and nonpharmacological treatments, the inclusion of parents, improving interprofessional collaboration, and considering the setting were identified as important elements. Discussion The results of this review show that there is a need to improve the methodological quality of guidelines for procedural pain in newborns. The set of recommendations for procedural pain prevention needs to involve not only pharmacological and nonpharmacological pain treatment but also parents and interprofessional collaboration. It is also essential to take into account facilitators, barriers, and the context to improve pain management.",0
https://doi.org/10.1016/j.urolonc.2020.03.013,Incident testicular cancer in relation to using marijuana and smoking tobacco: A systematic review and meta-analysis of epidemiologic studies,"Abstract Background Recent epidemiologic studies identified credible associations between marijuana smoking and risk of nonseminomatous testicular germ cell tumors (TGCTs), but did not distinguish exposure to cannabinoid compounds from exposure to other constituents of smoke. Methods We implemented a systematic review of scholarly literature followed by random effects meta-analysis to quantitatively synthesize published data relating incident TGCT to each of 2 exposure histories: ever using marijuana, and ever smoking tobacco. Results We identified four epidemiologic studies of marijuana use and 12 of tobacco smoking. Summary data concur with earlier reports of a specific association of marijuana use with nonseminoma, summary odds ratio [sOR] = 1.71 (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.12–2.60), and identify a positive association, sOR = 1.18 (95% CI 1.05–1.33), between tobacco smoking and all TGCT. Conclusions Available data accord with positive associations between incident TGCT and each exposure, implicating both cannabinoid compounds and other constituents of smoke. Etiologic interpretation awaits epidemiologic studies that assess associations between tobacco smoking and nonseminomatous TGCT, investigating not only these exposures but also both co-use of tobacco and marijuana and smoke-free sources of cannabinoids, while adequately evaluating potential confounding among all of these exposures.",0

Se han analizado todos los ensayos clínicos publicados hasta la fecha y evaluado los resultados obtenidos en cuanto a la mejora del equilibrio, marcha y realización de actividades diarias postratamiento Encontramos una mejora significativa de la postura (p < 0,008), marcha (p < 0,02), así como una reducción de la puntuación de la subescala SARAg&p (marcha y postura) e índice SCAFI 8 MW (velocidad de marcha) (p = 0,02). También observamos mejora en desórdenes del habla (p = 0,02), síntomas depresivos (p < 0,0001) y caídas accidentales (p < 0,005). A pesar de la controversia en aspectos relacionados con la intensidad, la temporalidad y la duración de las mejoras conseguidas, queda constatada la efectividad clínica del tratamiento rehabilitador en estos pacientes, especialmente en aspectos como la marcha y el equilibrio. Evidence of the effectiveness of rehabilitation interventions in spinocerebellar ataxia is scarce and variable. The aim of this systematic review was to gather the existing evidence on the effectiveness of these interventions. To do this, we analysed all the clinical trials published to date and assessed their results in terms of improved balance, gait, and performance of daily activities after treatment. Significant improvements were found for posture (P <.008) and gait (P <.02), as well as a reduction in the scores for the SARAg&p subscale (gait and posture) and SCAFI 8 MW index (gait speed) (P =.02). We also observed improvements in speech disorders (P =.02), depressive symptoms (P <.0001) and accidental falls (P <.005).",0

However, there are many challenges associated with their launch and up-keep. The objective of this systematic review was to define the impacts of institutional repositories (IRs) on an academic institution, thus justifying their implementation and/or maintenance.A comprehensive literature search was performed in the following databases: Ovid MEDLINE, Ovid EMBASE, the Cochrane Library (Wiley), ERIC (ProQuest), Web of Science (Core Collection), Scopus (Elsevier), and Library, Information Science & Technology Abstracts (EBSCO). A total of 6,593 citations were screened against predefined inclusion and exclusion criteria.Thirteen included studies were divided into 3 areas of impact: citation count, exposure or presence, and administrative impact. Those focusing on citation count (n=5) and exposure or presence (n=7) demonstrated positive impacts of IRs on institutions and researchers. One study focusing on administrative benefit demonstrated the utility of IRs in automated population of ORCID profiles.Based on the available literature, IRs appear to have a positive impact on citation count, exposure or presence, and administrative burden. To draw stronger conclusions, more and higher-quality studies are needed.",0

We conducted a systematic literature review to examine the gender differences in healthcare utilisation of lung cancer patients. Our aim was to synthesise evidence to assess whether men and women utilise cancer diagnosis and treatments differently. The databases of PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, EBSCO Host, Ovid nursing, and Cochrane was systematically searched. We used pre-defined eligibility criteria to identify peer-reviewed published literature that reported healthcare use of lung cancer patients. Two reviewers independently screened the title, abstract, full texts and retrieved relevant data. A total of 42 studies met the eligibility criteria from 1356 potential studies. In these studies, the most commonly measured healthcare utilisation is surgery (n = 19), followed by chemotherapy (n = 13). All the studies were from developed countries and had a higher percentage of male participants. Substantial evidence of heterogeneity in the use of treatments by gender were found. In relation to diagnosis interval and stage of cancer diagnosis, it was found that women had longer diagnostic intervals. Nonetheless, women tend to get diagnosed at an earlier stage. Furthermore, women had a higher probability of using inpatient cancer-care services and surgical treatments. Conversely, men had greater risks of readmission after surgery and longer length of stay. Lastly, there were no significant gender differences in the likelihood of receiving chemotherapy and radiation therapy. This study synthesised evidence of disparities in the use of lung cancer treatments based on gender in developed countries, with no evidence available from least-developed and developing countries. Further studies are required to understand this gender-specific inequality and to design interventions to improve the survival rate of lung cancer patients.",0

There is an increasing interest in the effect of lifestyle and reproductive factors on CBC risk, since these factors may partly be modifiable. We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis and aimed to evaluate the impact of lifestyle and reproductive factors on CBC risk in population-based breast cancer studies. Methods The PubMed electronic database was searched up to 2nd November 2019, for relevant publications. Of the included studies, a meta-analysis per lifestyle or reproductive factor was performed. Results Thirteen out of 784 publications were used for the meta-analysis. Body mass index (≥ 25 vs. &lt; 25 kg/m 2 ; RR = 1.22; 95% CI 1.01–1.47) was associated with increased CBC risk. The estimates for alcohol use (ever vs. never; RR = 1.15; 95% CI 1.02–1.31) and age at primiparity (≥ 25 vs. &lt; 25 years; RR = 1.06; 95% CI 1.02–1.10) also showed an association with increased CBC risk. For parity (≥ 4 vs. nulliparous; RR = 0.56; 95% CI 0.42–0.76) and age at menopause (&lt; 45 vs ≥ 45 years; RR = 0.79; 95% CI 0.67–0.93), results from two studies suggested a decreased CBC risk. We observed no association between CBC and smoking, age at menarche, oral contraceptive use, gravidity, breastfeeding, or menopausal status. Overall, the number of studies per risk factor was limited ( n = 2–5). Conclusions BMI is a modifiable risk factor for CBC. Data on the effect of other modifiable lifestyle and reproductive factors are limited. For better counseling of patients on lifestyle effects, more studies are urgently needed.",0

Search criteria included all occurrences in the title or abstract of the terms: ""integrase interactor 1 deficient,"" ""INI1 deficient,"" or ""SMARCB1 deficient"" and ""sinonasal carcinoma."" The main outcomes were disease-free survival, all-cause mortality, rates of recurrence, or metastases.Systematic search yielded 13 studies for final review. All studies were either case series or case reports with 82 cases of SDSC published since 2014. Age on presentation ranged from 19 to 75 years, with the majority of patients being male. Surgical resection was the primary modality of treatment with adjuvant radiation or chemoradiation therapy. Overall, the prognosis was poor, with most tumors presenting at advanced stages with an overall median (range) survival of 22 (12-44) months with an average (standard deviation) of 45.3% (33.1%) of patients dying of the disease. An average (standard deviation) of 38.2% (34.0%) of patients had no evidence of disease at follow-up. Studies comparing sinonasal undifferentiated carcinoma to SDSC reported worse prognosis for SDSC and increased risk for locoregional recurrence in the latter cohort.SDSC represents a highly aggressive tumor presenting at advanced stage with propensity of metastasis. More research is necessary to determine the optimal treatment modality and management.",0

However, there is no randomized controlled trial (RCT) systematic review that evaluates the impact of vaccination on all-cause mortality compared to no vaccination in this particular population. Our objective is to conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis of the impact of pneumococcal vaccination in the referred population.We searched CENTRAL and MEDLINE for relevant RCTs and observational studies. Data were screened, extracted, and appraised by two independent reviewers. We pooled results using a random effects model, and used hazard ratios (HRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) to assess measure of effect. The primary outcome was all-cause mortality and we assessed the confidence in the evidence using the GRADE framework. No RCTs were found. Seven observational studies were included for analyses. Pooled results from five studies enrolling a total of 163 756 participants showed a significant decrease in all-cause mortality (HR 0.78, 95% CI 0.73-0.83, very low confidence), without statistically significant heterogeneity (χ2 test P = 0.21; I2 = 32%).Pneumococcal vaccination was associated with a 22% decrease of all-cause mortality in patients with cardiovascular disease or at a very high cardiovascular risk. However, limitations due to study design and the serious risk of bias in three of the included studies leads to a decreased level of result confidence.",0

The objective of this study was to estimate the risk of stomach cancer after occupational talc exposure. Methods We conducted a meta-analysis was performed to calculate the meta-relative risk (mRR) of stomach cancer. We searched the MEDLINE, EMBASE, CNKI and Wanfang Data databases for publications prior to January 1, 2017 using talc, cancer, and mortality as the search terms. Only cohort studies with occupational talc exposure and stomach cancer statistics were included. Results All pooled analyses were based on random-effects models. We selected 13 observational studies (12 publications) for the meta-analysis, and heterogeneity was observed among studies. Workers exposed to all forms of talc had a significantly increased mRR of 1.21 (95% CI: 1.03—1.42, p = 0.02) for stomach cancer. Workers exposed to talc not containing asbestiform fibers also had an increased mRR of 1.26 (95% CI: 0.97—1.63, p = 0.09). Conclusion The available data showed a positive association between occupational talc exposure and risk of stomach cancer. The association between talc not containing asbestiform fibers and risk of stomach cancer was not significant. Further epidemiological studies are required to evaluate the safety of talc.",1

Electronic search was conducted through nine databases including PubMed for relevant publications reporting cardiovascular events and mortality among pet owners. Meta-analysis was used to pool the results. Of a total of 2818 reports screened, 26 studies were included in our systematic review and meta-analysis. Higher survival rate was observed in the pet owners group after pooling nonadjusted and adjusted hazard ratios for cardiovascular mortality at 0.73 [95% confidence interval (CI) 0.62-0.86] and 0.81 (0.68-0.97), respectively. A similar trend was observed for the pooled nonadjusted hazard ratio for overall mortality 0.73 (0.62-0.87) but not the adjusted hazard ratio 0.40 (0.04-3.78). Cat owners have a reduction in cardiovascular mortality but not overall mortality after pooling the adjusted hazard ratio 0.79 (0.63-0.99) and 1.04 (0.90-1.21), respectively. However, no significant association between dog owners and survival rate was observed for overall and cardiovascular-specific mortality. Pet owners had significantly lower heart rate (mean difference 95% CI: -2.32 (-3.07 to -1.57), mean arterial pressure -2.60 (-4.25 to -0.95) and SBP -1.69 (-3.06 to -0.31) but not DBP -0.23 (-1.05 to 0.60). No significant difference was observed between pet owners and nonpet owners in prevalence of hypertension. Our study draws attention to the beneficial effects of the human--pet bond; therefore, we recommend pet acquisition for better cardiovascular outcomes after controlling for zoonotics and pet-induced allergies.",0

We searched the MEDLINE, Embase, the Cochrane Central Register for Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), PsycINFO, and Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL) databases and included articles published up to December 2019 (PROSPERO: CRD42019111668). We assessed reporting quality using the 13-item checklist. Of the 80 articles identified, 42 (53%) were published after 2010. The overall reporting quality before and after 2010 was poor and did not differ significantly (mean difference: 0.66, 95% confidence interval [CI]: −0.21 to 1.53). The total reporting scores of the studies did not differ significantly according to the effect size of the intervention (beta coefficient: −2.86, 95% CI: −5.77 to 0.04). This study demonstrates the need to improve the quality of reporting CBPRs. We recommend that journal editors endorse the CBPR reporting guideline to encourage its use by more researchers.",0
https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijsu.2020.03.016,Effects of preoperative warming on the occurrence of surgical site infection: A systematic review and meta-analysis,"To determine whether preoperative warming can reduce the risk of surgical site infection (SSI) after surgery. Intraoperative hypothermia is a risk factor for the occurrence of SSI in patients after surgery. However, the effectiveness of preoperative warming in reducing the incidence of the condition remains unclear. A systematic review was conducted using Medline, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Library to identify randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that evaluated the risk of SSI after surgery with and without the use of a preoperative warming protocol. The primary outcome measure was the diagnosis of SSI within 10–90 days of surgery. The pooled risk ratio was estimated with a fixed-effect meta-analysis. Sensitivity analyses were performed to examine the impact of the structural design of preoperative warming on the pooled risk of SSI. Of the 249 studies identified, seven RCTs representing 1086 patients were included in the present meta-analysis. The use of preoperative warming was associated with a significant decrease in SSI (RR = 0.60, 95% CI 0.42–0.87, P = 0.072). Specifically, we defined patients who used forced-air warming (FAW) and integrated measures such as liquid heating and warming blankets as the MIX group and patients who used only FAW as the FAW group. Patients who used MIX methods (temperature set <43 °C and 30-min prewarming) before surgery benefited more from prewarming. The results of this study suggest that preoperative warming can reduce rates of SSI after surgery. We, therefore, recommend the application of MIX warming methods before surgery. • Preoperative warming is effective for surgical site infection (SSI). • MIX warming method was recommended. • Prewaming 30 min is enough. • Setting the temperature below 43 °C is recommended.",0

We performed a systematic review describing oncologic and toxicity outcomes for salvage EBRT/stereotactic radiation therapy (SBRT) re-RT.A International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews registered (#141466) systematic review, meta-analysis, and meta-regression was conducted using preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses guidelines. PubMed and EMBASE were searched from inception through September 2019. Outcome measures included local control (LC), biochemical relapse free survival (BRFS), and ≥grade 3 genitourinary (GU)/gastrointestinal (GI) toxicity. EBRT and SBRT data were collected separately. Meta-regression explored disease and toxicity outcomes as a function of equivalent dose in 2 Gy fractions (EQD2), length of follow-up, and partial versus whole prostate reirradiation.Nineteen studies representing 13 cohorts were included (428 patients). Weighted mean follow-up was 26.1 months. Median re-RT EQD2 was 77.1 Gy (α/β = 1.5), with 92% of patients receiving SBRT, 52.1% of patients receiving partial prostate re-RT, and 30.1% of patients receiving androgen deprivation therapy with re-RT. LC was 83.2% (95% confidence interval [CI], 75.5%-90.9%) and BRFS was 59.3% (47.9%-70.7%). Reported late toxicity ≥grade 3 was 3.4% (95% CI, 1.0%-5.8%) for GU and 2.0% (95% CI, 0.1%-4.0%) for GI. Meta-regression found higher LC, BRFS, and reported GU/GI toxicity with increasing EQD2, with partial prostate re-RT associated with less reported GU/GI toxicity and no detriment to LC and BRFS.Salvage re-RT using EBRT, particularly with SBRT, is an emerging technique to treat isolated local failure of prostate cancer. With short-term follow-up, LC, BRFS, and reported toxicities appear reasonable, although further follow-up is required before definitive statements on late toxicities can be made. Our review is limited by incomplete reporting of androgen deprivation therapy use in the primary literature. Further prospective studies and longer follow-up are needed before considering re-RT as standard practice.",0
https://doi.org/10.1186/s12978-020-00913-y,Psychosocial interventions targeting mental health in pregnant adolescents and adolescent parents: a systematic review,"Pregnancy and parenthood are known to be high-risk times for mental health. However, less is known about the mental health of pregnant adolescents or adolescent parents. Despite the substantial literature on the risks associated with adolescent pregnancy, there is limited evidence on best practices for preventing poor mental health in this vulnerable group. This systematic review therefore aimed to identify whether psychosocial interventions can effectively promote positive mental health and prevent mental health conditions in pregnant and parenting adolescents. We used the standardized systematic review methodology based on the process outlined in the World Health Organization’s Handbook for Guidelines Development. This review focused on randomized controlled trials of preventive psychosocial interventions to promote the mental health of pregnant and parenting adolescents, as compared to treatment as usual. We searched PubMed/Medline, PsycINFO, ERIC, EMBASE and ASSIA databases, as well as reference lists of relevant articles, grey literature, and consultation with experts in the field. GRADE was used to assess the quality of evidence. We included 17 eligible studies (n = 3245 participants). Interventions had small to moderate, beneficial effects on positive mental health (SMD = 0.35, very low quality evidence), and moderate beneficial effects on school attendance (SMD = 0.64, high quality evidence). There was limited evidence for the effectiveness of psychosocial interventions on mental health disorders including depression and anxiety, substance use, risky sexual and reproductive health behaviors, adherence to antenatal and postnatal care, and parenting skills. There were no available data for outcomes on self-harm and suicide; aggressive, disruptive, and oppositional behaviors; or exposure to intimate partner violence. Only two studies included adolescent fathers. No studies were based in low- or middle-income countries. Despite the encouraging findings in terms of effects on positive mental health and school attendance outcomes, there is a critical evidence gap related to the effectiveness of psychosocial interventions for improving mental health, preventing disorders, self-harm, and other risk behaviors among pregnant and parenting adolescents. There is an urgent need to adapt and design new psychosocial interventions that can be pilot-tested and scaled with pregnant adolescents and adolescent parents and their extended networks, particularly in low-income settings.",0
https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjspcare-2019-001934,Paediatric palliative care: a systematic review,"Objectives To review literature relating to evidence, context and facilitation to describe knowledge translation in paediatric palliative care. Paediatric palliative care requires competences including both paediatric specialists as well as services that are developed for this purpose, and there is a need to facilitate paediatric palliative care knowledge translation. Promoting Action on Research Implementation in the Health Services (PARiHS) is a framework for knowledge translation, which highlights the relationships between evidence, context and facilitation. PARiHS framework has been revised and updated in a new version called i-PARiHS. Methods The electronic databases AgeLine, CINAHL, The Cochrane Library, PsycINFO, PubMed and Scopus were searched. Papers included were limited to English and Swedish publications and restricted to publications dated between 1993 and August 2019. All types of observational and experimental studies using any research design were included. Results and conclusions Thirty-eight articles were included and there was a common vision about how and when palliative care should be offered to children. The i-PARiHS was used as a lens to describe the knowledge translation in paediatric palliative care. Symptom relief was the most commonly described evidence-based strategy, and the hospital environment was the most commonly described context. Different types of education were the most commonly used strategies to facilitate knowledge translation. The results mainly focused on increasing knowledge of palliative care in paediatric care. To sum up, the results report strategies to achieve knowledge translation of paediatric palliative care, and these can be interpreted as a guideline for how this process can be facilitated.

https://doi.org/10.1055/s-0040-1702151,Unique Complications of Venous Anastomotic Couplers: A Systematic Review of the Literature,"Abstract Background Anastomotic couplers expedite venous microvascular anastomoses and have been established as an equivalent alternative to hand-sewn anastomoses. However, complications unique to the coupler such as palpability and extrusion can occur. The purpose of this study was to perform a systematic review of the literature to assess complications distinct to the venous anastomotic coupler. Methods A Medline, PubMed, EBSCO host search of articles involving anastomotic venous couplers was performed. Studies involving arterial anastomotic couplers, end-to-side anastomoses, and reviews were excluded. Data points of interest were flap failure, venous thrombosis, hematoma, partial flap necrosis, infection, coupler extrusion, and coupler palpability. Results The search identified 165 articles; 41 of these met inclusion criteria. A total of 8,246 patients underwent 8,955 venous-coupled anastomoses. Combined reoperation rate was 3.3% and all-cause unsalvageable flap failure was 1.0%. Complications requiring reoperation included venous thrombosis (2.0%), hematoma (0.4%), partial flap necrosis (0.4%), and infection (0.3%). Eight patients had palpable couplers and 11 patients had extrusion of couplers (head/neck, hand, and feet) and required operative management. Conclusion Venous couplers remain an equivalent alternative to conventional hand-sewn anastomosis. However, venous coupler extrusion and palpability in the late postoperative period is a complication unique to anastomotic couplers, particularly in radiated head and neck, feet and hand free flaps. Removing extruded venous couplers is safe after tissue integration 3 weeks postoperatively. Coupler palpability and extrusion should be integrated into preoperative patient counseling and assessed in follow-up examinations.",0

Design A systematic review of multiple databases (MEDLINE, Emcare, CINAHL, PsycINFO, Informit and Scopus) was conducted from the inception of the databases to 1 April 2019 using the preferred reporting items for systematic review and meta-analysis guidelines. Eligibility criteria All relevant studies investigating and comparing heat illness and heat tolerance in women and men in the armed forces were included in the review. Results Twenty-four studies were included in the systematic review. The incidence of heat stroke in women ranged from 0.10 to 0.26 per 1000 person-years, while the incidence of heat stroke ranged from 0.22 to 0.48 per 1000 person-years in men. The incidence of other heat illnesses in women compared with men ranged from 1.30 to 2.89 per 1000 person-years versus 0.98 to 1.98 per 1000 person-years. The limited evidence suggests that women had a greater risk of exertional heat illness compared with men. Other gender-specific risk factors were slower run times and body mass index. Although there was a higher proportion of women who were heat intolerant compared with men, this finding needs to be interpreted with caution due to the limited evidence. Conclusion The findings of this review suggest that men experienced a slightly higher incidence of heat stroke than women in the armed forces. In addition, the limited available evidence suggests that a higher proportion of women were heat intolerant and being a female was associated with a greater risk of exertional heat illnesses. Given the limited evidence available, further research is required to investigate the influence of gender differences on heat intolerance and heat illness.",0

A random-effect model was employed to determine the pooled hazard ratio (HR) for Progression-Free Survival (PFS) and Overall Survival (OS) using the inverse-variance method. The Mantel Haenszel method was used to calculate the pooled odds ratio (OR) for treatment-related side effects. Heterogeneity was measured using the tau-squared and I2 statistics.Three phase III RCTs (n = 1916) were included in the systematic review. Use of abemaciclib, palbociclib, or ribociclib in combination with fulvestrant was significantly associated with longer PFS compared to use of fulvestrant alone (HR: 0.53; 95%CI: 0.47-0.60; p<0.00001), with no significant heterogeneity found among trials. Similarly, OS was significantly longer for patients who received combination therapy in comparison with those allocated to receive fulvestrant alone (HR: 0.77; 95%CI: 0.67-0.89; p<0.0004). The overall odds ratio of serious adverse events (AE) was not significantly increased with the use of the combination therapy (OR: 1.51; 95%CI: 0.74-3.08), with significant heterogeneity found among trials (tau2=0.34; I2=86%; p = 0.0006).The addition of CDK 4/6 inhibitors (either abemaciclib, palbociclib, or ribociclib) to fulvestrant significantly improved PFS and OS in comparison with fulvestrant alone in patients previously treated with endocrine therapy for advanced breast cancer. No significant heterogeneity was found among CDK 4/6 inhibitors.",0
https://doi.org/10.1038/s41370-020-0236-0,Advancing systematic-review methodology in exposure science for environmental health decision making,"Systematic review (SR) is a rigorous methodology applied to synthesize and evaluate a body of scientific evidence to answer a research or policy question. Effective use of systematic-review methodology enables use of research evidence by decision makers. In addition, as reliance on systematic reviews increases, the required standards for quality of evidence enhances the policy relevance of research. Authoritative guidance has been developed for use of SR to evaluate evidence in the fields of medicine, social science, environmental epidemiology, toxicology, as well as ecology and evolutionary biology. In these fields, SR is typically used to evaluate a cause-effect relationship, such as the effect of an intervention, procedure, therapy, or exposure on an outcome. However, SR is emerging to be a useful methodology to transparently review and integrate evidence for a wider range of scientifically informed decisions and actions across disciplines. As SR is being used more broadly, there is growing consensus for developing resources, guidelines, ontologies, and technology to make SR more efficient and transparent, especially for handling large amounts of diverse data being generated across multiple scientific disciplines. In this article, we advocate for advancing SR methodology as a best practice in the field of exposure science to synthesize exposure evidence and enhance the value of exposure studies. We discuss available standards and tools that can be applied and extended by exposure scientists and highlight early examples of SRs being developed to address exposure research questions. Finally, we invite the exposure science community to engage in further development of standards and guidance to grow application of SR in this field and expand the opportunities for exposure science to inform environment and public health decision making.",0

This systematic review and meta-analysis identified predictors of participant nonadherence to returning for annual LDCT screening. The systematic review protocol was registered at PROSPERO (CRD42019118347). MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, AgeLine, grey literature sources, and reference lists of included studies were searched until March 1st, 2020. Primary research articles were eligible for inclusion if they screened current or former smokers using LDCT as their primary screening modality and reported on participant demographics or programmatic interventions that predicted nonadherence. Risk of bias assessment was performed at both study and outcome levels. The primary outcome was predictors of nonadherence. The secondary outcomes were relative risks (RR) of second round nonadherence based on identified predictors, which were calculated using random-effects meta-analyses. Across 13 included studies (total n = 15,790; range: 157–3642), the overall rate of nonadherence was 28% (95% CI: 20–37%). Studies identified greater nonadherence in participants younger than 60 or older than 74, with longer travel distances to screening centers, and having a low risk perception of lung cancer. Meta-analyses identified higher nonadherence in community-based compared to academic-based programs, but this did not reach significance (32% <i>versus</i> 27%; <i>p</i> <i>=</i> 0.32). Current smokers were more likely to be nonadherent compared to former smokers (RR 1.23, 95% CI: 1.09–1.40; <i>p</i> < 0.01) while white participants were less likely nonadherent compared to non-white participants (RR 0.69, 95% CI: 0.60–0.81; <i>p</i> <i><</i> 0.0001). No differences existed between male and female participants (RR 0.99, 95% CI: 0.85–1.15; <i>p</i> = 0.85). Programmatic interventions, including dedicated program coordinators, reminder calls/letters, and mobile LDCT scanners reduced nonadherence in lung cancer screening programs. These interventions should be targeted/tailored toward the subpopulations with the highest nonadherence rates.",0

During the last decade, hydrotherapy has spread in a very heterogeneous rehabilitation field. However, the efficacy of this kind of rehabilitation is not clear in scientific literature. The purpose of this study is to conduct a systematic review with meta-analysis to evaluate the qualitative and quantitative results of physical therapy treatments in an aquatic setting for individuals with Multiple Sclerosis. Method PRISMA guidelines were used to carry out the systematic review and meta-analysis. Three bibliographic databases were searched: MEDLINE, PEDro, and the Cochrane Library. Papers included in the study have the following characteristics: (a) a randomized controlled trial design of research and (b) published in English. The quality of the clinical trials included were evaluated according to a Jadad score and through meta-analysis. Results After the elimination of duplicates, 116 records were screened. Among these, 11 Randomized Controlled Trials (RCTs) were included in the systematic review. Ten of these were involved in the meta-analysis. From the qualitative analysis, a larger number of studies were found with a high level of quality. Most of the results of the quantitative analysis were statistically significant (p Conclusion Aquatic physical therapy is a valid means of rehabilitation for people with Multiple Sclerosis. The integration of this methodological approach with conventional physical therapy is recommended. Nevertheless, more studies, a larger number of participants, and short-, medium-, and long-term follow-up are required to confirm current results.",0

Evidence exists indicating a low level of general health literacy among Black African women, especially those with a refugee background. Breast and cervical are the most common cancers, with Black African women or women with African ethnicity being disproportionately overrepresented. The level of health literacy specific to breast and cervical cancer among Black African women, especially those with a refugee background, has not been reviewed systematically. The present study describes a protocol for a systematic review of the available evidence on the level of health literacy specific to breast and cervical cancer among Black African women globally. We will perform a systematic review of the available quantitative and qualitative studies. The search will include studies that describe the level of health literacy specific to breast and cervical cancer among Black African women. We will conduct a preliminary search on Google scholar to build the concepts for search terms, and a full search strategy using the identified concepts and keywords across four databases namely PubMed, SCOPUS, CINAHL and Web of Sciences. We will use Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) to schematically present the search strategy. We will use the standardized Joanna Briggs Institute quality appraisal and selection tool to recruit studies, and the data extraction tool to synthesise the information extracted from the recruited studies. We will be guided by socioecological theory and Indigenous epistemology to synthesise the non-quantifiable information thematically, and pool the quantitative information using meta-analysis, based on the availability of information.",0
https://doi.org/10.1186/s13023-020-1339-3,"Health, wellbeing and lived experiences of adults with SMA: a scoping systematic review","Spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) is a neurodegenerative disease that has a substantial and multifaceted burden on affected adults. While advances in supportive care and therapies are rapidly reshaping the therapeutic environment, these efforts have largely centered on pediatric populations. Understanding the natural history, care pathways, and patient-reported outcomes associated with SMA in adulthood is critical to advancing health policy, practice and research across the disease spectrum. The aim of this study was to systematically review research investigating the healthcare, well-being and lived experiences of adults with SMA.In accordance with the Preferred Reported Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis guidelines, seven electronic databases were systematically searched until January 2020 for studies examining clinical (physical health, natural history, treatment) and patient-reported (symptoms, physical function, mental health, quality of life, lived experiences) outcomes in adults with SMA. Study risk of bias and the level of evidence were assessed using validated tools.Ninety-five articles met eligibility criteria with clinical and methodological diversity observed across studies. A heterogeneous clinical spectrum with variability in natural history was evident in adults, yet slow declines in motor function were reported when observational periods extended beyond 2 years. There remains no high quality evidence of an efficacious drug treatment for adults. Limitations in mobility and daily activities associated with deteriorating physical health were commonly reported, alongside emotional difficulties, fatigue and a perceived lack of societal support, however there was no evidence regarding effective interventions.This systematic review identifies the many uncertainties regarding best clinical practice, treatment response, and long-term outcomes for adults with SMA. This comprehensive identification of the current gaps in knowledge is essential to guide future clinical research, best practice care, and advance health policy with the ultimate aim of reducing the burden associated with adult SMA.",0

Two reviewers independently extracted study data and assessed each study's risk of bias. We examined heterogeneity, and calculated summary effect estimates using fixed- and random effects models. Quality of evidence was determined with GRADE.We included 15 studies (one post hoc analysis of a randomised trial, nine cohort and five case-control studies). Elderly IBD patients treated with biologics were at increased risk of developing serious infections (random effects summary relative risk: 2.70, 95% CI: 1.56-4.66; seven studies; I2 = 57%) and opportunistic infections (3.16, 1.09-9.20; four studies; I2 = 73%). The occurrence of any infection (1.67, 0.51-5.43; five studies; I2 = 75%) and cancer (0.90, 0.64-1.26; nine studies; I2 = 0%) was not significantly affected. Nevertheless, our confidence in the effect estimates is rather limited; the quality of evidence is low to very low.Biologics are likely to increase the risk of serious and opportunistic infections in old IBD patients. Large prospective studies are needed to further assess the biologic treatments' long-term safety profile in this population.",0

Data sources: Systematic searches of Ovid Medline, Ovid Embase, Cochrane Central and grey literature, dating from the oldest entry to August 2017. Review methods: Search criteria included English language peer reviewed articles and theses on physical abuse cases affecting the age group of 0-17 years. Exclusion criteria were: Case reports and &lt;10 case series; studies involving bite mark injuries elsewhere on the body, sexual, ritualistic or emotional abuse and neglect, exposure to domestic violence; reviews; book chapters and conference proceedings. The following data was extracted: quality and design of study, oro-facial manifestations, new/old injuries, fatalities, coexistent injuries, co-morbidities and radiologic investigations. Each study was subjected to two independent reviews and a third, if reviewers disagreed. Results: The authors identified 51 articles, 26 of which satisfied the inclusion criteria. The oro-facial signs were superficial injuries of face, ears, neck, lips and oral mucosa, burns, torn fraenii and fractured teeth and jaws. A minority of studies stood out due to their well-developed design; expert opinion inclusion; new/old/occult injury investigations and facial bruising/ intraoral injuries as sentinel markers. Overall, the review demonstrated weak study quality and representativeness as well as lacunae in uniform reporting. Conclusions: The available literature does not endorse any pathognomonic signature patterns of child physical abuse to the exposed oro-facial region.",0

This umbrella review examined (1) what relationship, if any, is evident between specific spinal postures or physical activities and LBP; (2) the quality of existing systematic reviews in this area; and (3) the extent to which previous systematic reviews demonstrate causality. Five electronic databases and reference lists of relevant articles were searched from January 1990 to June 2018. Systematic reviews and meta-analyses on spine posture or physical exposure and LBP symptoms (self-report) or outcomes (e.g. work absence, medical consultation) were included. The AMSTAR and the Bradford Hill Criteria were utilised to critically appraise the quality of included systematic reviews and to determine the extent to which these reviews demonstrated causality. Two independent reviewers screened 4285 publications with 41 reviews included in the final review. Both positive and null associations between spine posture, prolonged standing, sitting, bending and twisting, awkward postures, whole body vibration, and components of heavy physical work were reported. Results from meta-analyses were more consistently in favour of an association, whereas systematic reviews that included only prospective studies were less able to provide consistent conclusions. Evidence that these factors precede first time LBP or have a dose response relationship with LBP outcomes was mixed. Despite the availability of many reviews, there is no consensus regarding causality of physical exposure to LBP. Association has been documented but does not provide a causal explanation for LBP.",0

PUBMED, Web of Science, Cochrane Library, and Scopus databases were searched for articles published prior to December 2019 according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-analysis statement. Studies were deemed eligible if they compared overall survival (OS), combined progression-free survival (PFS), combined prostate specific antigen (PSA)-PFS, and PSA response rates in CRPC patients receiving sequential ABI/ENZ or vice versa. PSA response to both the first and second agents was defined as a >50% decrease in PSA achieved with each of these agents. Formal meta-analyses were performed for these outcomes. Ten studies with 1096 patients were eligible for the systematic review and eight studies with 643 patients for the meta-analysis. The ABI-to-ENZ sequence was significantly associated with better PFS (pooled hazard ratio (HR): 0.62, 95% confidential interval (CI): 0.49–0.78, P < 0.001), and PSA–PFS (pooled HR: 0.48, 95% CI: 0.38–0.61, P < 0.001) than the ENZ-to-ABI sequence. PSA response rates of both agents were significantly better with the ABI-to-ENZ sequence (risk ratio: 0.21, 95% CI: 0.09–0.47, P < 0.001). In contrast, treatment sequence was not significantly associated with OS (pooled HR: 0.77, 95% CI: 0.59–1.01, P = 0.055). ABI-to-ENZ sequential therapy in patients with CRPC was associated with better PFS, PSA–PFS, and PSA response rates. Regardless of sequencing, response to drug therapy was transient for both ABI and ENZ when either agent was used as a secondary therapy. Despite this, treatment sequencing is important to achieve the maximum possible benefit from available drugs in CRPC.",0
https://doi.org/10.1177/1539449220912187,Influence of Purposeful Activities on Upper Extremity Motor Performance: A Systematic Review,"Following upper extremity injury, exercise-approaches are commonly used to address motor impairments. Occupation-based approaches are also used but less widely promoted and their mechanisms of action not well-understood. Movement performed during purposeful activities and occupations may yield better motor performance than during nonpurposeful tasks. This review investigated the influence of engagement in purposeful activities and occupations on upper extremity motor performance in healthy and musculoskeletal populations. Databases were searched for studies in healthy or upper extremity musculoskeletal–injured adults that compared motor performance during purposeful activities against nonpurposeful movements. Twenty-one studies of moderate quality, conducted predominantly in healthy populations, were included. Upper extremity movement quantity and quality were enhanced when performed during purposeful conditions. Purposeful activities have potential to be used following injury to enhance movement and address motor impairments to a greater extent than is currently promoted. Research in musculoskeletal populations is required.",0
https://doi.org/10.1002/rcs.2113,A systematic review of the true benefit of robotic surgery: Ergonomics,"Background Ergonomics, as defined by the optimization of one's physical environment to enhance work performance, is an important consideration in surgery. While there have been reviews on the ergonomics of laparoscopy, this has not been the case for robotic surgery despite the rising number of publications. Methods This study was performed in accordance to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. A search was performed on main databases to identify relevant articles. Results Twenty-nine articles were included, comprising 3074 participants. Studies employing objective measurement tools showed that robotics conferred superior ergonomic benefits and reduced work load compared to laparoscopy, for both surgeons and trainees. Survey studies also demonstrated that self-reported discomfort was lower in robotic procedures compared to laparoscopy and open surgery. Compared to other subspecialities, gynecological procedures seem to be associated with greater surgeon-reported strain. Conclusion Robotic surgery is ergonomically superior to open and laparoscopic surgery. However, rates of physical strain remain significant and should be addressed by formal ergonomic training and adequate console familiarization.",0
https://doi.org/10.1158/1078-0432.ccr-19-3359,Determining the Optimal Adjuvant Therapy for Improving Survival in Elderly Patients with Glioblastoma: A Systematic Review and Network Meta-analysis,"Abstract Purpose: Older patients with glioblastoma (GBM) are underrepresented in clinical trials. Several abbreviated and standard chemoradiotherapy regimens are advocated with no consensus on the optimal approach. Our objective was to quantitatively evaluate which of these regimens would provide the most favorable survival outcomes in older patients with GBM using a network meta-analysis. Experimental Design: MEDLINE, Embase, Google Scholar, and the Cochrane Library were searched. Patients &amp;gt;60 years of age with histologically confirmed GBM were included. Primary outcome of interest was the pooled HR from randomized controlled trials (RCTs). Secondary outcomes of interest included pooled HR from studies controlling for MGMT promoter methylation status, and safety. Results: Fourteen studies, including 5 RCTs, reporting 4,561 patients were included. Using highest quality data from RCTs, our network-based approach demonstrated that standard radiotherapy (SRT) and temozolomide (TMZ) provided similar survival benefit when compared with hypofractionated radiotherapy (HRT) and TMZ [HR = 0.90; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.43–1.87], TMZ alone (HR 1.25; 95% CI, 0.69–2.26), HRT alone (HR = 1.34; 95% CI, 0.73–2.45), or SRT alone (HR = 1.43; 95% CI, 0.87–2.36). HRT-TMZ had the highest probability (85%) of improving survival in older patients with GBM followed by SRT-TMZ (72%). Pooled analysis of trials controlling for MGMT promoter methylation status demonstrated that TMZ monotherapy confers similar survival benefit to combined chemoradiotherapy. Conclusions: Statistical comparisons using a network approach demonstrates that the common treatment regimens for older patients with GBM in previous RCTs confer similar survival benefits. Adjustments for MGMT promoter methylation status demonstrated that radiotherapy alone was inferior to TMZ-based approaches.

We hypothesised that M tuberculosis BSI prevalence has been underestimated, that it independently predicts death, and that sputum Xpert MTB/RIF has suboptimal diagnostic yield for M tuberculosis BSI. Methods We did a systematic review and individual patient data (IPD) meta-analysis of studies performing routine mycobacterial blood culture in a prospectively defined patient population of people with HIV aged 13 years or older. Studies were identified through searching PubMed and Scopus up to Nov 10, 2018, without language or date restrictions and through manual review of reference lists. Risk of bias in the included studies was assessed with an adapted QUADAS-2 framework. IPD were requested for all identified studies and subject to harmonised inclusion criteria: age 13 years or older, HIV positivity, available CD4 cell count, a valid mycobacterial blood culture result (excluding patients with missing data from lost or contaminated blood cultures), and meeting WHO definitions for suspected tuberculosis (presence of screening symptom). Predicted probabilities of M tuberculosis BSI from mixed-effects modelling were used to estimate prevalence. Estimates of diagnostic yield of sputum testing with Xpert (or culture if Xpert was unavailable) and of urine lipoarabinomannan (LAM) testing for M tuberculosis BSI were obtained by two-level random-effect meta-analysis. Estimates of mortality associated with M tuberculosis BSI were obtained by mixed-effect Cox proportional-hazard modelling and of effect of treatment delay on mortality by propensity-score analysis. This study is registered with PROSPERO, number 42016050022. Findings We identified 23 datasets for inclusion (20 published and three unpublished at time of search) and obtained IPD from 20, representing 96·2% of eligible IPD. Risk of bias for the included studies was assessed to be generally low except for on the patient selection domain, which was moderate in most studies. 5751 patients met harmonised IPD-level inclusion criteria. Technical factors such as number of blood cultures done, timing of blood cultures relative to blood sampling, and patient factors such as inpatient setting and CD4 cell count, explained significant heterogeneity between primary studies. The predicted probability of M tuberculosis BSI in hospital inpatients with HIV-associated tuberculosis, WHO danger signs, and a CD4 count of 76 cells per μL (the median for the cohort) was 45% (95% CI 38–52). The diagnostic yield of sputum in patients with M tuberculosis BSI was 77% (95% CI 63–87), increasing to 89% (80–94) when combined with urine LAM testing. Presence of M tuberculosis BSI compared with its absence in patients with HIV-associated tuberculosis increased risk of death before 30 days (adjusted hazard ratio 2·48, 95% CI 2·05–3·08) but not after 30 days (1·25, 0·84–2·49). In a propensity-score matched cohort of participants with HIV-associated tuberculosis (n=630), mortality increased in patients with M tuberculosis BSI who had a delay in anti-tuberculosis treatment of longer than 4 days compared with those who had no delay (odds ratio 3·15, 95% CI 1·16–8·84). Interpretation In critically ill adults with HIV-tuberculosis, M tuberculosis BSI is a frequent manifestation of tuberculosis and predicts mortality within 30 days. Improved diagnostic yield in patients with M tuberculosis BSI could be achieved through combined use of sputum Xpert and urine LAM. Anti-tuberculosis treatment delay might increase the risk of mortality in these patients. Funding This study was supported by Wellcome fellowships 109105Z/15/A and 105165/Z/14/A .",0

We conducted this systematic review and meta-analysis to assess the impact of hypofractionation in early glottic cancers. We performed a comprehensive search of the PubMed, Embase and Google scholar to look for studies which have evaluated the role of hypofractionation in early glottic cancers. Only prospective trials were included in the present analysis. RevMan software (Cochrane Collaboration’s Information Management System) was used for the meta-analysis. The analysis included a total of five studies and 1153 patients. Hypofractionation was found to significantly improve local control rates with an Odds ratio of 0.55 [95% CI 0.13–0.85]. The voice preservation rates with hypofractionation ranged from 86 to 94%. No significant improvement in overall survival was noted with the used of hypofractionation [hazard ratio 1.09, 95% CI 0.69–1.71]. There was an increased incidence of grade 2 or higher acute mucositis toxicity with use of hypofractionation [Odds ratio 1.54, 95% CI 1.12–2.11]. The incidence of acute skin toxicity was not increased with use of hypofractionation. Late toxicity was very low and not increased with use of hypofractionation. Moderate hypofractionation as compared to conventional fractionation, in laryngeal cancer, is associated with significantly improved local control without impact on overall survival. The use of hypofractionation is associated with an increased incidence of acute mucositis though incidence of long-term toxicity was not significantly increased. Hence, moderate-dose hypo-fractionation should be considered as the new standard of care in early laryngeal cancer.",0
https://doi.org/10.1016/j.envint.2020.105736,A novel study evaluation strategy in the systematic review of animal toxicology studies for human health assessments of environmental chemicals,"• This paper presents a novel animal study evaluation method for systematic reviews. • The method incorporates concepts of reporting quality, risk of bias and sensitivity. • Subject matter expertise of the reviewers inform specific considerations. • Domain and confidence ratings are generally made at the outcome level vs study. • Examples from DIBP and DEP reviews are presented. A key aspect of the systematic review process is study evaluation to understand the strengths and weaknesses of individual studies included in the review. The present manuscript describes the process currently being used by the Environmental Protection Agency’s (EPA) Integrated Risk Information System (IRIS) Program to evaluate animal toxicity studies, illustrated by application to the recent systematic reviews of two phthalates: diisobutyl phthalate (DIBP) and diethyl phthalate (DEP). The IRIS Program uses a domain-based approach that was developed after careful consideration of tools used by others to evaluate experimental animal studies in toxicology and pre-clinical research. Standard practice is to have studies evaluated by at least two independent reviewers for aspects related to reporting quality, risk of bias/internal validity (e.g., randomization, blinding at outcome assessment, methods used to expose animals and assess outcomes, etc.), and sensitivity to identify factors that may limit the ability of a study to detect a true effect. To promote consistency across raters, prompting considerations and example responses are provided to reviewers, and a pilot phase is conducted. The evaluation process is performed separately for each outcome reported in a study, as the utility of a study may vary for different outcomes. Input from subject matter experts is used to identify chemical- and outcome-specific considerations (e.g., lifestage of exposure and outcome assessment when considering reproductive effects) to guide judgments within particular evaluation domains. For each evaluation domain, reviewers reach a consensus on a rating of Good , Adequate , Deficient , or Critically Deficient . These individual domain ratings are then used to determine the overall confidence in the study ( High Confidence , Medium Confidence , Low Confidence , or Deficient ). Study evaluation results, including the justifications for reviewer judgements, are documented and made publicly available in EPA’s version of Health Assessment Workspace Collaborative (HAWC), a free and open source web-based software application.

Given the unacceptable blood lead levels and the near ignorance or negligence of heavy metals in both diagnoses and management of diseases in Nigeria, it is feared that these metals are involved in the aetiogenesis of several ailments from preeclampsia, metabolic syndrome, cancer, etc. This is an insight on Nigerian fermented foods and their possible role as metal chelators in the management of the chronic heavy metal exposure in Nigeria. One hundred and five articles fulfilled the inclusion criteria. Google scholar, PubMed and SCOPUS were searched for articles reporting fermented foods and probiotics in Nigeria. Only studies published in English Language were included, but there was no limitation in year of study. One hundred and five articles fulfilled the inclusion criteria. Studies from some African countries suggest that fermented foods of probiotics relevance have effectively shown metal chelation properties. Consumption of Nigerian fermented foods may hold a promise in checking the high body burden of heavy metals in Nigeria. Graphic abstract.",0

The aim of this systematic review was to synthesise evidence regarding the effectiveness of interventions to increase provision of preventive care by mental health services; by care element (ask, assess, advice, assist, arrange) and risk behaviour (tobacco smoking, poor nutrition, harmful alcohol consumption, physical inactivity). Electronic bibliographic databases, Google Scholar, relevant journals, and included study reference lists were searched. Eligible studies were of any design with a comparison group that reported the effectiveness of an intervention to increase the provision of at least one element of preventive care for at least one risk behaviour in a mental health setting. Twenty studies were included, most commonly examining smoking (n = 20) and 'ask' (n = 12). Meta-analysis found interventions involving task shifting were effective in increasing smoking 'advice' (n = 2 RCTs; p = 0.009) and physical activity 'advice' (n = 2 RCTs; p = 0.002). Overall, meta-analysis and narrative synthesis indicated that effective intervention strategies (categorised according to the Effective Practice and Organisation of Care taxonomy) were: task shifting, educational meetings, health information systems, local consensus processes, authority and accountability, and reminders. The most consistent findings across studies were with regard to preventive care for smoking, while conflicting or limited evidence was found regarding other risk behaviours. While further rigorous research examining key risk behaviours is recommended, the findings may inform the selection of strategies for future interventions and service delivery initiatives.",0

The mechanism of liver injury is poorly understood and may result as a consequence of viral hepatitis, systemic inflammatory response, gut barrier and microbiome alterations, intensive care treatment or drug toxicity. The incidence of hepatopathy among patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is unclear, but studies have reported liver injury in patients with SARS and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS). We aimed to systematically review data on the prevalence of hepatic impairments and their clinical course in SARS and MERS Coronaviridae infections. A systematic literature search (PubMed/Embase/Cinahl/Web of Science) according to preferred reporting items for systematic review and meta-analysis protocols (PRISMA) was conducted from database inception until 17/03/2020 for studies that evaluated the incidence of hepatic abnormalities in SARS CoV-1, SARS CoV-2 and MERS infected patients with reported liver-related parameters. A total of forty-three studies were included. Liver anomalies were predominantly mild to moderately elevated transaminases, hypoalbuminemia and prolongation of prothrombin time. Histopathology varied between non-specific inflammation, mild steatosis, congestion and massive necrosis. More studies to elucidate the mechanism and importance of liver injury on the clinical course and prognosis in patients with novel SARS-CoV-2 infection are warranted.",0

Radial-endobronchial ultrasound (R-EBUS) and electromagnetic navigation bronchoscopy (ENB) are 2 methods to sample PPLs to diagnose and treat early lung cancer. ENB has a higher operating financial cost, however, the rationale for its use is possible higher diagnostic accuracy versus R-EBUS. Objective: The objective of this study was to determine the comparative diagnostic accuracy, sensitivity, and negative predictive value for R-EBUS and ENB in sampling PPLs. Methods: A systematic review and meta-analysis were conducted. The Ovid Medline database was queried for original research reporting a diagnostic yield of R-EBUS or ENB for PPLs identified on computed tomography chest suspicious for malignancy. The I2 statistic assessed study heterogeneity. Random effects models produced pooled estimates of diagnostic accuracy and sensitivity for malignancy. Reasons for heterogeneity were explored with meta-regression. Publication bias and small study effects were assessed. Results: A total of 41 studies involved 2988 lung nodules (R-EBUS 2102, ENB 886) in 3204 patients (R-EBUS 2097, ENB 1107). Overall sensitivity to detect cancer was 70.7% [95% confidence interval (CI): 67.2-74.0]; R-EBUS 70.5% (95% CI: 66.1-74.8), ENB 70.7% (95% CI: 64.7-76.8). Pooled overall diagnostic accuracy was 74.2% (95% CI: 71.0-77.3); R-EBUS 72.4% (95% CI: 68.7-76.1), ENB 76.4% (95% CI: 70.8-82.0). The localization modalities had comparative safety profiles of <2% complications. Conclusion: Both technologies have a high proportion of successful PPL localization with similar sensitivity for malignancy and accuracy. As such, both reasonable options for health care authorities to employ diagnostic algorithms.",0

Objectives. - To describe the effects of NMV on postural orientation and spatial perception, in both healthy people and patients with disturbed balance potentially related to distorted body orientation perception. Methods. - Following the PRISMA guidelines, a systematic search was performed using the databases MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane library and PEDrO with the key words ((Postural balance) OR (Spatial reference)) AND (Neck muscle vibration) for articles published through to July 2016. Results. - A total of 67 articles were assessed; these exhibited wide heterogeneity and generally poor quality methodology. In healthy subjects, under bilateral NMV, the body tilts in the anterior direction (Level of Evidence LoE II). Under unilateral NMV, the visual environment moves towards the side opposite the vibration (LoE II) and the subject's experience of straight ahead is shifted towards the side of the vibration (LoE II). NMV also modulates both spatial and postural bias between stroke and vestibular patients. Discussion. - NMV modulates both spatial and postural bias and could thus be proposed as a tool in rehabilitative therapy. However, due to the heterogeneity of published data and the various significant shortfalls highlighted, current research does not allow clear guidelines to be proposed. (C) 2019 Elsevier Masson SAS.

Using keywords such as “smoking”, “grilling”, “processing”, “roasting”, “barbecue”, “curing”, “reduction”, “decrease”, “polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon”, “benzo(a)pyrene”, “removal”, 1191 references were collected from databases. After sorting, only 37 appeared to be relevant to the topic of the review. These 37 papers were coded with one or two keywords representing methods of PAHs reduction using R-based Qualitative Data Analysis library. The results showed that PAHs reduction strategies can be applied either before (or during) grilling or smoking (barrier methods) or after grilling or smoking (removal methods). Before grilling or smoking, use of marinade, preheating of products, appropriate fuel (poor in lignin), filter, collection system of juice and fat (to avoid them dripping into embers) are the main strategies which can be applied. After grilling or smoking, the methods consist of washing the surface of smoked or grilled products with hot water (60 °C) or storing smoked products packed into low density or high density polyethylene. A flowchart regrouping methods which can be used individually or in combination for PAHs reduction in smoked meat and fishery products is suggested.",0

Although strict regulations have been put in place to limit their release into the aquatic environment, these nanoparticles can still be found at elevated levels within the environment, which can result in toxic effects on exposed organisms and has possible implications in term of public health. Bivalve mollusks are a unique and ideal group of shellfish for the study and monitoring the aquatic pollution by n-TiO2 because of their filter-feeding behaviour and ability to accumulate toxicants in their tissues. In these animals, exposure to n-TiO2 leads to oxidative stress, immunotoxicity, neurotoxicity, and genotoxicity, as well as behavioral and physiological changes. This review summarizes the uptake, accumulation, and fate of n-TiO2 in aquatic environments and the possible interactions between n-TiO2 and other contaminants such as heavy metals and organic pollutants. Moreover, the toxicological impacts and mechanisms of action are discussed for a wide range of bivalve mollusks. This data underlines the pressing need for additional knowledge and future research plans for the development of control strategies to mitigate the release of n-TiO2 to the aquatic environment to prevent the toxicological impacts on bivalves and protect public health.",0

Even so, the use of mouthwashes with alcohol in their compositions and the increased risk of oral cancer has been a source of controversy for decades.This study proposes a systematic review and a meta-analysis of the literature, to assess the possible relationship between the use of mouthwashes with alcohol and the development of oral and pharyngeal cancers.A systematic search was done using the Medline and PubMed databases. Exclusion criteria were as follows: articles published in languages other than English or Spanish, systematic reviews, and expert opinions. No limitations were used for publication date.A total of 14 articles were obtained, 11 case-control studies and 3 clinical trials. Three case-control studies found no statistically significant evidence between the relationship of mouthwash use and oral cancer and the remaining 8 case-control studies found statistically significant evidence. The 3 clinical trials observed a relationship between the use of mouthwashes with alcohol and the possibility of developing cancer due to the genotoxicity and mutagenic capacity of alcohol in chronic contact with oral tissues and mucous membranes. The meta-analysis resulted in an OR = 1.480 and a P-value = .161 (95% CI: 0.855; P-value = 2.561) for the analysis of studies of cancer risk and consumption of mouthwashes with alcohol and OR = 1.057 0.364 (95% CI: 0.951; P-value = 1.174) for studies that related the risk of cancer and mouthwash use without taking into account the presence of alcohol.There is no sufficient evidence to accept the proposition that the use of mouthwashes containing alcohol can influence the development of oral cancer.",1

Research investigating the effect of modifiable lifestyle factors on ANS activity in young children is limited. Early identification of these risk factors is vital to improving long-term individual and public health outcomes. A systematic review was conducted to assess the effect of maternal or child modifiable lifestyle factors on child ANS activity. Methods Following the 2009 PRISMA guidelines, three electronic databases were searched from February 2018 – July 2019 for articles describing human trials between 1996 – 2019. Included studies examined ANS activity of children between 28 weeks gestational age – 6 years in relation to modifiable lifestyle CVD risk factors. Results Twenty-six studies fulfilled inclusion criteria. Sixteen studies reported that modifiable lifestyle factors significantly influenced the HRV of children. Increased HRV was significantly associated with higher maternal zinc and omega-3 fatty acid intake, regular maternal aerobic exercise and a non-smoking environment. Child diet and body composition demonstrated some support for an association between these modifiable lifestyle factors and child HRV. Conclusion There is cross-sectional evidence supporting an association between maternal lifestyle factors and child HRV. Evidence is less supportive of a relationship between child modifiable lifestyle factors and child HRV. Monitoring the effects of lifestyle interventions on the ANS via HRV measurements of both mother and child may identify child CVD risk.",0

There is a lack of evidence-based literature providing clinical and organizational guidelines for the management of a general surgery department. Aim of our study was to review the available recommendations published by general Surgery Societies and Health Institutions and evaluate the underlying Literature. A review of the English Literature was conducted according to the AMSTAR and to the 2009 Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) guidelines. After eligibility assessment, a total of 22 papers and statements were analyzed. Surgical societies have established criteria for triage and prioritization in order to identify procedures that can be postponed after the pandemic and those that should not. Prioritization among oncologic cases represents a difficult task: clinicians have to balance a possible delay in cancer diagnosis or treatment against the risk for a potential COVID-19 exposure. There is broad agreement among guidelines that indication to proceed with surgery should be discussed in virtual Tumor Boards taking into consideration alternative therapeutic approaches. Several guidelines deal with the role of laparoscopic surgery during the pandemic: a tailored approach is currently suggested, with a case-by-case evaluation provided that appropriate personal protective equipment is available in order to minimize the potential risk of transmission. Finally, there is a considerable agreement in the published Literature concerning the management of the personnel during the peri- and intraoperative phase and on the technical advices regarding the induction, operative and recover maneuvers in COVID-19 cases. During COVID-19 pandemic, it is of paramount importance to face the emergency in the most effective and efficient manner, retrieving resources from non-essential settings and, at the same time, providing care to high priority non-COVID-19 related diseases.",0

However, it has a nascent role in radiation oncology. The goal of this investigation is to clarify the extent to which 3D printing applications are currently being used in radiation oncology through a systematic review of the literature. MATERIALS/METHODS A search protocol was defined according to preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. Included articles were evaluated using parameters of interest including: year and country of publication, experimental design, sample size for clinical studies, radiation oncology topic, reported outcomes, and implementation barriers or safety concerns. RESULTS One hundred and three publications from 2012 to 2019 met inclusion criteria. The most commonly described 3D printing applications included quality assurance phantoms (26%), brachytherapy applicators (20%), bolus (17%), preclinical animal irradiation (10%), compensators (7%), and immobilization devices (5%). Most studies were preclinical feasibility studies (63%), with few clinical investigations such as case reports or series (13%) or cohort studies (11%). The most common applications evaluated within clinical settings included brachytherapy applicators (44%) and bolus (28%). Sample sizes for clinical investigations were small (median 10, range 1-42). A minority of articles described basic or translational research (11%) and workflow or cost evaluation studies (3%). The number of articles increased over time (P < 0.0001). While outcomes were heterogeneous, most studies reported successful implementation of accurate and cost-effective 3D printing methods. CONCLUSIONS Three-dimensional printing is rapidly growing in radiation oncology and has been implemented effectively in a diverse array of applications. Although the number of 3D printing publications has steadily risen, the majority of current reports are preclinical in nature and the few clinical studies that do exist report on small sample sizes. Further dissemination of ongoing investigations describing the clinical application of developed 3D printing technologies in larger cohorts is warranted.",0

However, to our knowledge, a meta-analysis of the differences between modern TCSIs and electrocautery (EC) has not been conducted. Objective To compare TCSIs with EC with regard to the intraoperative and postoperative parameters of tonsillectomy. Data Sources PubMed (MEDLINE), Embase, and the Cochrane Library were searched independently by 2 authors for relevant articles. Study Selection A literature search identified randomized clinical trials comparing the outcomes of TCSIs vs EC. The search keywords wereharmonic scalpel,ultracision,PlasmaBlade,coblation,radiofrequency ablation, andtonsillectomy. Studies of adult and adolescent patients were included. Data Extraction and Synthesis Data from each study were extracted. A random-effects model was used in the pooled analysis. Main Outcomes and Measures Four outcomes were analyzed: postoperative pain level on days 1, 2, 7, and 14 after surgery; postoperative bleeding; operative time; and intraoperative blood loss. Results This meta-analysis included 11 studies with a total of 629 unique patients. (Mean ages ranged from 16 to 55 years.) The studies were further categorized by the methods of comparison. Five articles used between-participant comparisons, and 6 used within-participant comparisons (of the left vs right sides of the participant’s body). The pooled results of the studies with between-participant measures showed that postoperative pain scores were lower in the TCSI group on the first day (standardized mean differences [SMD], −0.41 [95% CI, −0.77 to −0.06]) and seventh day (SMD, −0.76 [95% CI, −1.47 to −0.04]). The pooled results of the studies with within-participant measures showed that the postoperative pain scores were lower in the TCSI group on the first day (SMD, −0.37 [95% CI, −0.63 to −0.12]) and second day (SMD, −0.60 [95% CI, −1.10 to −0.10]). The pooled analysis of overall bleeding, major bleeding, minor bleeding, primary bleeding, and secondary bleeding in both the types of studies with between-participant measures and those with within-participant measures showed no significant differences between the TCSI and EC groups. Intraoperative blood loss and operative time were not significantly different between the groups. Conclusions and Relevance Compared with EC, TCSIs were associated with significantly reduced pain on the first day after tonsillectomy, per this meta-analysis. The rates of overall bleeding, primary bleeding, secondary bleeding, major bleeding, and minor bleeding between TCSIs and EC were comparable. Intraoperative blood loss and operative time also showed no significant intergroup differences. Surgeons may consider using these modern instruments according to personal experiences, preferences, and cost-effectiveness criteria.",0

The additive role of endovascular thrombectomy remains unclear. The objective was to perform systematic review and meta-analysis to compare endovascular thrombectomy and medical therapy for acute ischemic stroke associated with cervical artery dissection. Studies from six electronic databases included outcomes of patient cohorts with acute ischemic stroke secondary to cervical artery dissection who underwent treatment with endovascular thrombectomy. A meta-analysis of proportions was conducted with a random effects model. Modified Rankin score at 90 days (mRS 0–2) was the primary outcome. Other outcomes included proportion of patients with thrombolysis in cerebral infarction (TICI) 2b-3 flow, 90-day mortality rate, and 90-day symptomatic intracerebral hemorrhage (sICH) rate. Six studies were included, comprising 193 cases that underwent thrombectomy compared with 59 cases that were managed medically. Successful recanalization with a pooled proportion of thrombolysis in cerebral infarction (TICI) 2b-3 flow in the thrombectomy group was 74%. Favorable outcome (mRS 0–2) was superior in the pooled thrombectomy group (62.9%, 95% CI 55.8–69.5%) compared with medical management (41.5%, 95% CI 29.0–55.1%, P = 0.006). The pooled rate of 90-day mortality was similar for endovascular vs medical (8.6% vs 6.3%). The pooled rate of symptomatic intracranial haemorrhage (sICH) did not significantly differ (5.9% vs 4.2%, P = 0.60). Current data suggest that endovascular thrombectomy may be an option in patients with acute ischemic stroke due to cervical artery dissection. This requires further confirmation in higher quality prospective studies.",0
https://doi.org/10.1016/j.eururo.2020.02.012,Systematic Review of the Therapeutic Efficacy of Bladder-preserving Treatments for Non–muscle-invasive Bladder Cancer Following Intravesical Bacillus Calmette-Guérin,"There is a critical need for effective bladder-sparing therapies for bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG)-unresponsive non–muscle-invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC). Owing to the current lack of effective agents that can be used as a control, the US Food and Drug Administration began to accept single-arm trials for patients with carcinoma in situ (CIS), using complete response rate (CRR) and duration of response as the primary endpoints to support marketing applications. Despite the ensuing growth of clinical trials in this space, no consensus exists on a clinically relevant benchmark for CRR. To elucidate the CRR and recurrence-free rate (RFR) using bladder-sparing agents after BCG failure in order to provide a frame of reference for future clinical trial results. We performed a systematic review of clinical trials utilizing bladder-sparing therapeutics for NMIBC recurring after intravesical BCG (PROSPERO CRD42019130553). The search was performed in MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Cochrane Library. Relevant studies identified from bibliography search and conference abstracts were searched to complement the systematic review. A total of 42 studies utilizing 24 treatment options and consisting of 2254 patients were included for final analysis. Median CRRs in the treatment of CIS-containing tumors were 26% at 6 mo, 17% at 12 mo, and 8% at 24 mo after treatment. In comparison, median RFRs in the papillary-only studies were 67% at 6 mo, 44% at 12 mo, and 10% at 24 mo. Specifically in the BCG-unresponsive population, 6- and 12-mo CRRs in CIS-containing patients treated with Mycobacterium phlei cell wall–nucleic acid complex were 45% and 27%, respectively, and the median 6-, 12-, and 24-mo disease-free rates in the other studies were 43%, 35%, and 18%, respectively. The median progression-free rate was 91%: 95% in the CIS-containing studies and 89% in studies restricted to papillary-only recurrences. Toxicities of intravesical agents were generally mild, with very few dose limiting toxicities. We demonstrate that, to date, bladder-sparing therapies achieved modest efficacy in patients with NMIBC after BCG. Results from the current study will serve as a frame of reference for emerging trial results in the BCG-unresponsive space. In this study, we found that bladder-sparing therapies achieved modest efficacy in patients with non–muscle-invasive bladder cancer after bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG). These results will serve to inform future clinical trial results for salvage agents used to treat BCG-unresponsive bladder cancer. In this study, we found that bladder-sparing therapies achieved modest efficacy in patients with non–muscle-invasive bladder cancer after bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG). These results will serve to inform future clinical trial results for salvage agents used to treat BCG-unresponsive bladder cancer.",0
https://doi.org/10.1111/jdv.16253,Critical synthesis of available data in <i>Malassezia</i> folliculitis and a systematic review of treatments,"Folliculitis is an inflammatory process involving the hair follicle, frequently attributed to infectious causes. Malassezia, an established symbiotic yeast that can evolve to a skin pathogen with opportunistic attributes, is a common source of folliculitis, especially when intrinsic (e.g. immunosuppression) or extrinsic (high ambient temperature and humidity, clothing) impact on the hair follicle and the overlying skin microenvironment. Our aim was to critically review the pathophysiology and clinical characteristics of Malassezia folliculitis, to describe laboratory methods that facilitate diagnosis and to systematically review treatment options. Malassezia manifests as a pruritic, follicular papulopustular eruption distributed on the upper trunk. It commonly affects young to middle-aged adults and immunosuppressed individuals. Inclusion into the differential diagnosis of is regularly oversighted, and the prerequisite-targeted diagnostic procedures are not always performed. Sampling by tape stripping or comedo extractor and microscopic examination of the sample usually identifies the monopolar budding yeast cells of Malassezia without the presence of hyphae. However, confirmation of the diagnosis with anatomical association with the hair follicle is performed by biopsy. For systematic review of therapies, PubMed was searched using the search string (malassezia [MeSH Terms] OR malassezia [All Fields] OR pityrosporum [All Fields]) AND folliculitis [MeSH Terms] and EMBASE was searched using the search string: 'malassezia folliculitis.mp OR pityrosporum folliculitis.mp'. In total, 28 full-length studies were assessed for eligibility and 21 were selected for inclusion in therapy evaluation. Conclusively Malassezia should be considered in the assessment of truncal, follicular skin lesions. Patient's history, comorbidities and clinical presentation are usually indicative, but microscopically and histological examination is needed to confirm the diagnosis. Adequate samples obtained with comedo extractor and serial sections in the histological material are critical for proper diagnosis. Therapy should include systemic or topical measures for the control of the inflammation, as well as the prevention of recurrences.",0

The aim of this systematic review was to assess cardiovascular clinical and procedural implications of CVC anomalies in adults without congenital heart disease. <h3>Methods and results</h3> We searched PubMed and EMBASE from database conception through October 2018 for English-language studies describing the epidemiology of CVC anomalies or their clinical or procedural implications in humans. Two independent reviewers screened 7093 records and identified 16 relevant studies. We found two major implications of CVC anomalies: 1) congenital inferior vena cava (CIVC) anomalies are associated with a 50–100-fold higher risk of deep venous thrombosis, particularly among younger patients, and 2) persistent left superior vena cava (PLSVC) is associated with a 2–3-fold higher risk of supraventricular arrhythmias. PLSVC also poses technical challenges to cardiovascular electronic device implantation, requiring alterations in surgical approach and lengthening procedure and X-ray exposure times. Due to the large disparity in reported prevalence rates of CIVC anomalies, we performed a meta-analysis of CIVC anomaly prevalence including 8 studies, which showed a weighted prevalence of 6.8% (95% CI, 4.5–9.2%). <h3>Conclusion</h3> These findings challenge the notion that CVC anomalies are rare and asymptomatic in adults. Rather, the literature indicates that CVC anomalies are not uncommon and have important clinical and procedural implications. To further understand the prevalence and implications of CVC anomalies, a robust US population-based study and nationwide registry is warranted in the current era of venous interventions.",0
https://doi.org/10.1007/s11606-019-05366-z,Patient Outcomes Following Interhospital Care Fragmentation: A Systematic Review,"Interhospital fragmentation of care occurs when patients are admitted to different, disconnected hospitals. It has been hypothesized that this type of care fragmentation decreases the quality of care received and increases hospital costs and healthcare utilization. This systematic review aims to synthesize the existing literature exploring the association between interhospital fragmentation of care and patient outcomes. MEDLINE, the Cochrane Library, EMBASE, and the Science Citation Index were systematically searched for studies published up to April 30, 2018 reporting the association between interhospital fragmentation of care and patient outcomes. We included peer-reviewed observational studies conducted in adults that reported measures of association between interhospital care fragmentation and one or more of the following patient outcomes: mortality, hospital length of stay, cost, and subsequent hospital readmission. Seventy-nine full texts were reviewed and 22 met inclusion criteria. Nearly all studies defined fragmentation of care as a readmission to a different hospital than the patient was previously discharged from. The strongest association reported was that between a fragmented readmission and in-hospital or short-term mortality (adjusted odds ratio range 0.95–3.62). Over half of the studies reporting length-of-stay showed longer length of stay in fragmented readmissions. All three studies that investigated healthcare utilization suggested an association between fragmented care and odds of subsequent readmission. The study populations and exposures were too heterogenous to perform a meta-analysis. Our review suggests that fragmented hospital readmissions contribute to increased mortality, longer length-of-stay, and increased risk of readmission to the hospital.",0

Lifestyle changes in particular are recommended in the latest guidelines for implementing secondary prevention. Aim The aim of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of telehealth interventions as a part of secondary prevention compared to routine care in those with coronary artery disease. Method The systematic review with meta-analysis was performed in accordance with Cochrane methods. Science Direct, Springer Link, Web of Science, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, CINAHL, MEDLINE, ProQuest and Network Digital Library databases were searched between 2000 and 2018 up to February 2018. The studies chosen conformed to PICOS inclusion and exclusion criteria. The risk of bias was assessed using the Cochrane risk of bias tool. Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guideline was used in reporting the study. Results Twenty-four studies with a total of 6773 study participants met the inclusion criteria. It was found that telephone call interventions were the most commonly used, text message interventions came second with seven studies, telephone calls in combination with messages were used in four studies and telemonitoring was used in two studies. Compared to routine care, telehealth interventions had moderate significant effects in reducing waist circumference, total cholesterol and triglyceride, improving medication adherence and physical activity, and had small significant effects in reducing blood pressure and smoking cessation. No significant publication bias was found in the main outcomes. Conclusion Results showed that the telehealth interventions yielded positive outcomes in lifestyle changes for coronary artery disease. Therefore, telehealth interventions can be used for effective secondary prevention by health professionals who care for individuals with coronary artery disease. Additionally, this study will provide guidance for studies on the development of telehealth intervention.",0
https://doi.org/10.1177/1352458520907901,"Systematic review and meta-analysis of the association between Epstein–Barr virus, multiple sclerosis and other risk factors","Background: Epstein–Barr virus (EBV) infection is thought to play a central role in the development of multiple sclerosis (MS). If causal, it represents a target for interventions to reduce MS risk. Objective: To examine the evidence for interaction between EBV and other risk factors, and explore mechanisms via which EBV infection may influence MS risk. Methods: Pubmed was searched using the terms ‘multiple sclerosis’ AND ‘Epstein Barr virus’, ‘multiple sclerosis’ AND EBV, ‘clinically isolated syndrome’ AND ‘Epstein Barr virus’ and ‘clinically isolated syndrome’ AND EBV. All abstracts were reviewed for possible inclusion. Results: A total of 262 full-text papers were reviewed. There was evidence of interaction on the additive scale between anti-EBV antibody titre and HLA genotype (attributable proportion due to interaction (AP) = 0.48, p &lt; 1 × 10 −4 ). Previous infectious mononucleosis (IM) was associated with increased odds ratio (OR) of MS in HLA-DRB1*1501 positive but not HLA-DRB1*1501 negative persons. Smoking was associated with a greater risk of MS in those with high anti-EBV antibodies (OR = 2.76) but not low anti-EBV antibodies (OR = 1.16). No interaction between EBV and risk factors was found on a multiplicative scale. Conclusion: EBV appears to interact with at least some established MS risk factors. The mechanism via which EBV influences MS risk remains unknown.",0

The main objective of this study was to evaluate the risk of major congenital malformations (MCM), cardiac defects and orofacial clefts associated with first trimester exposure to ondansetron using a meta-analytic approach. MEDLINE, ClinicalTrials.gov and Scopus were searched until November 2019. All comparative cohort and case-control studies on MCM, cardiac or orofacial defects and use of ondansetron during pregnancy were included. A team of paired reviewers independently extracted data using a proprietary collaborative WEB-based meta-analysis platform (metaPreg.org). Pooled odd ratios with corresponding 95% CIs were calculated using random effects models. From 214 records initially retrieved, 12 studies were included. Using all available information to date, first trimester exposure to ondansetron was found to be associated with an increased risk of (a) ventricular septal defects (VSD) (OR 1.11, 95% CI 1.00-1.23; p < .05; n = 6 studies; I2 = 0%) and (b) oral clefts (OR 1.22, 95% CI 1.00-1.49; p < .05; n = 4 studies; I2 = 0%). No significant association was observed for the risk of cleft palate but, when excluding the study that contributed to the study heterogeneity, we found an OR of 1.48 (95% CI 1.19-1.84; p < .01; n = 5 studies; I2 = 0%). No statistically significant association was found for MCM, overall cardiac malformations, atrial septal defects and cleft lip with or without cleft palate. Exploratory investigations of other malformations showed an increased risk of diaphragmatic hernia, hypoplastic left heart and respiratory system anomalies.",0

An alternative approach to chemical treatments is to selectively enhance heritable honey bee traits of resistance or tolerance to the mite through breeding programs, or select for naturally surviving untreated colonies. We conducted a literature review of all studies documenting traits of A. mellifera populations either selectively bred or naturally selected for resistance and tolerance to mite parasitism. This allowed us to conduct an analysis of the diversity, distribution and importance of the traits in different honey bee populations that can survive V. destructor globally. In a second analysis, we investigated the genetic bases of these different phenotypes by comparing 'omics studies (genomics, transcriptomics, and proteomics) of A. mellifera resistance and tolerance to the parasite. Altogether, this review provides a detailed overview of the current state of the research projects and breeding efforts against the most devastating parasite of A. mellifera. By highlighting the most promising traits of Varroa-surviving bees and our current knowledge on their genetic bases, this work will help direct future research efforts and selection programs to control this pest. Additionally, by comparing the diverse populations of honey bees that exhibit those traits, this review highlights the consequences of anthropogenic and natural selection in the interactions between hosts and parasites.",0
https://doi.org/10.1177/0363546519882652,The Safety of Blood Flow Restriction Training as a Therapeutic Intervention for Patients With Musculoskeletal Disorders: A Systematic Review,"Background: The effectiveness of blood flow restriction training (BFRT) as compared with other forms of training, such as resistance training, has been evaluated in the literature in clinical and nonclinical populations. However, the safety of this intervention has been summarized only in healthy populations and not in clinical populations with musculoskeletal disorders. Purpose: To evaluate the safety and adverse events associated with BFRT in patients with musculoskeletal disorders. Study Design: Systematic review. Methods: A literature search was conducted with 3 online databases (MEDLINE, CINAHL, and Embase). Eligibility criteria for selecting studies were as follows: (1) BFRT was used as a clinical intervention, (2) study participants had a disorder of the musculoskeletal system, (3) authors addressed adverse events, (4) studies were published in English, and (5) the intervention was performed with human participants. Results: Nineteen studies met eligibility criteria, with a pooled sample size of 322. Diagnoses included various knee-related disorders, inclusion body myositis, polymyositis or dermatomyositis, thoracic outlet syndrome, Achilles tendon rupture, and bony fractures. Nine studies reported no adverse events, while 3 reported rare adverse events, including an upper extremity deep vein thrombosis and rhabdomyolysis. Three case studies reported common adverse events, including acute muscle pain and acute muscle fatigue. In the randomized controlled trials, individuals exposed to BFRT were not more likely to have an adverse event than individuals exposed to exercise alone. Of the 19 studies, the adverse events were as follows: overall, 14 of 322; rare overall, 3 of 322; rare BFRT, 3 of 168; rare control, 0 of 154; any adverse BFRT, 10 of 168; any adverse control, 4 of 154. A majority of studies were excluded because they did not address safety. Conclusion: BFRT appears to be a safe strengthening approach for knee-related musculoskeletal disorders, but further research is needed to make definitive conclusions and to evaluate the safety in other musculoskeletal conditions. Improved definitions of adverse events related to BFRT are needed to include clear criteria for differentiating among common, uncommon, and rare adverse events. Finally, further research is needed to effectively screen who might be at risk for rare adverse events.",0

Eligibility criteria included the following: study design of randomized controlled trials, quasi-randomized control trials, or natural experiments; average participant age between 18 and 35 years; study duration of at least 12 months; and published in English between January 2008 and May 2018. Studies had to report weight or body mass index as a measured outcome and were excluded if they were paired with smoking cessation programs, were conducted in specific groups (ie, pregnant women, breast cancer survivors), or were follow-ups to weight loss studies.After removing duplicates, the search yielded 11426 articles. Titles and abstracts were screened by 1 reviewer; 144 articles were assessed in a full-text review by 2 reviewers. Discrepancies were resolved by consensus. Nine studies (13 articles) were included in the review.Reported elements of the RE-AIM framework.A total of 9 studies met the selection criteria. All studies lacked full reporting on external validity elements. Of the total of 60 RE-AIM reporting criteria, 8 were reported by all 9 studies, 26 criteria were reported by fewer than 4 studies, and 22 criteria were not reported by any of the studies.There remains inadequate reporting of elements of external validity and generalizability in weight gain prevention studies. This is a significant scientific constraint that limits the information required to disseminate and implement prevention of weight gain interventions for population impact. Standardized reporting may be needed to ensure results that demonstrate not only internal validity but also external validity and generalizability are needed to promote public health impact.",0
https://doi.org/10.3390/brainsci10040227,Metronidazole Encephalopathy EEG Features: A Case Report with Systematic Review of the Literature,"Metronidazole-induced encephalopathy (MIE) is a rare and often under-recognized iatrogenic condition. The diagnosis should be considered in metronidazole-treated patients presenting with acute encephalopathy, unprovoked seizures and cerebellar signs. While typical magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings strongly support the diagnosis, electroencephalography (EEG) features have been rarely reported and poorly described. We present a longitudinal EEG assessment in one patient with encephalopathy due to metronidazole toxicity who presented a peculiar EEG pattern presentation and evolution. During the acute phase of encephalopathy, the EEG showed a monomorphic, sharply contoured theta activity symmetrically represented over frontal regions with an anterior–posterior progression which evolved in parallel with clinical worsening. Together with a systematic review of the literature, we discuss whether this EEG activity may represent a distinct neurophysiological correlate of ‘cerebellar encephalopathy’.",0

The aim of our analysis was to determine the relative efficacy of ICIs versus available standard therapies [standard of care (SOC)] in subgroups defined by patients' age. Searching the MEDLINE/PubMed, Cochrane Library, and American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) Meeting abstracts randomized clinical trials were identified. Data extraction was conduced according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) statement. The measured outcome was overall survival (OS). Twenty-nine randomized clinical trials (18,839 patients) were selected. As for the distribution of patients by age, all but 3 of the selected studies considered young the patients younger than 65 years (n=10,832) and elderly those with 65 years and older (n=7723); 7 studies identified a third subgroup of very elderly patients aged 75 years and above (n=421). In elderly and very elderly patients ICIs significantly reduced the risk of death by 23% compared with SOC [hazard ratio (HR), 0.77; P<0.00001)]. On the contrary, a lack of a survival advantage of immunotherapy was observed in the subgroup of very elderly patients (HR, 0.85; P=0.39). When comparing the efficacy of ICIs between the 2 subpopulations (elderly vs. young), no significant difference in OS was observed (HR, 0.76; P=0.66). ICIs prolonged OS compared with SOC in both elderly and young patients affected by lung cancer, melanoma, and renal carcinoma, regardless of the age. In conclusion, ICIs (as monotherapy or combinations) significantly improved OS compared with SOC in both young and elderly patients with advanced cancers, regardless of the tumor type. The magnitude of this benefit is debated in patients aged 75 years and above.",0

Thus, we conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of the peer-reviewed literature to assess the role of NAC in high-risk UTUC patients.PubMed, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Library were the main sources of relevant studies. The search terms included: ""Upper urothelial carcinoma""; ""UTUC""; ""Urinary tract cancer""; and ""Transitional cell carcinoma"" combined with ""Neoadjuvant chemotherapy"" and ""adjuvant chemotherapy"". We studied the relationship of UTUC and NAC. Overall survival, recurrent-free survival, cancer-specific survival and pathological response rate in patients treated with/without NAC before radical surgery were evaluated.Five trials were selected, and included 532 participants. Each of the included studies was retrospective. The combined analysis showed that when compared to controls, the pooled hazard ratios of overall survival, recurrence-free survival and cancer-specific survival were 0.47 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.34-0.64; P < .00001); 0.50 (95% CI, 0.37-0.66; P < .00001); and 0.37 (95% CI, 0.25-0.54; P < .00001), respectively. It indicates the beneficial effects of NAC for the prognosis of survival in UTUC. Additionally, NAC was significantly associated with T-stage down-grading (T3/4 to ≤T2; OR=7.58 [4.66, 12.33]; P < .0001) and pathological lymph node status (N+ to N0; OR = 6.24 [2.57,15.15]; P < .00001).NAC treatment before radical nephron-ureterectomy significantly improves survival prognosis in patients with high-risk upper tract urothelial carcinoma. However, considerable prospective and randomized studies are needed to confirm this perspective.",0

Aerodynamic toxic of particulate matter with <10 mm in diameter (PM10 ), or <2.5 mm (PM2.5 ), as well as nitric dioxide (NO2 ), have been linked with health issues. We aimed to perform a comprehensive analysis of the time-to-event for different types of air pollutants on cardiovascular disease (CVD) events based on cohort studies. METHODS A comprehensive search on topics that assesses air pollution and cardiovascular disease with keywords up until July 2019 was performed. RESULTS There were a total of 28 215 394 subjects from 84 cohorts. Increased PM2.5 was associated with composite CVD [HR 1.10 (1.02, 1.19)], acute coronary events [HR 1.15 (1.12, 1.17)], stroke [HR 1.13 (1.06, 1.19)], and hypertension [HR 1.07 (1.01, 1.14)], all-cause mortality [HR 1.07 (1.04, 1.09)], CVD mortality [HR 1.10 (1.07, 1.12)], and ischemic heart disease (IHD) mortality [HR 1.11 (1.07, 1.16)]. Association with AF became significant after removal of a study. Increased PM10 was associated with heart failure [HR 1.25 (1.04, 1.50)], all-cause mortality [HR 1.16 (1.06, 1.27)], CVD mortality [HR 1.17 (1.04, 1.30)], and IHD mortality [HR 1.03 (1.01, 1.05)].

Systematic Review of the Last Six Years,"A systematic review of the research conducted on Teaching Games for Understanding in Physical Education in the last six years (2014–2019), updating and expanding with new categories the last published review by Harvey and Jarret in 2014. Four databases were used to select those articles that included information on the implementation of Teaching Games for Understanding in different educational stages. According to PRISMA guidelines and including the PICO strategy after the exclusion criteria, 12 articles were fully assessed based on eight criteria: (1) year and author; (2) country; (3) number of participants, educational level, and duration of implementation; (4) type of research; (5) curricular content; (6) purpose of the research; (7) most relevant results; and (8) learning environment. The results showed how research focuses on both primary and secondary education, primarily in short-term interventions. Quantitative, qualitative and mixed research is used almost equally, and dealt evenly with sports and games, leaving motor skills, physical abilities and body expression underrepresented. Regarding the goals of the studies, motor and cognitive learning were the most frequently assessed, focusing on improvement of game development, such as tactical aspects, decision-making, technical skills or level of physical activity. The implementation of the model is carried out in too short a time to achieve significant outcomes. This review can help researchers and practitioners conduct Teaching Games for Understanding intervention programs in primary and secondary Physical Education. They must be rigorous when they claim that they implement this pedagogical model in schools.",0

On the basis of evidence derived from stroke rehabilitation, interventions aiming to increase intensity (i.e., duration and/or number of movements practiced) or alter brain plasticity (including motor imagery, virtual reality, transcranial direct-current or magnetic stimulations; i.e., neuromodulation) are now used during tetraplegic rehabilitation. However, no meta-analysis has investigated the efficacy of these interventions. This systematic review and meta-analysis investigated, separately, the efficacy of these interventions to alter hand-arm function, upper-limb strength, and functional independence of individuals with tetraplegia. Two independent reviewers followed the PROSPERO protocol (CRD42018098506) for this systematic review. MEDLINE, PEDro CENTRAL, and SCOPUS databases were searched for reports of randomized controlled trials of individuals with tetraplegia that were published in English. We performed a meta-analysis of intensive versus less intensive interventions and neuromodulation versus sham interventions considering hand-arm function, strength, and functional independence. From 168 records identified, we included 29 studies (all but 1 were single-centre) in the systematic review (647 participants with C2 to T1 tetraplegia [American Spinal Injury Association impairment scale A to D]). Interventions lasted from 66 to 40,320 min. Five studies were retained in the intensity meta-analyses and 5 in the neuromodulation meta-analyses. Overall, 3/5 and 1/5 studies had adequate methodology (Cochrane Risk of Bias score ≥ 6/10). For each outcome, the p-values for the overall effect were > 0.05. Heterogeneity was low, but when analyzing intensity, it was moderate for functional independence and high for hand-arm function. Quality of evidence was very low to low. We can provide no recommendations for using intensive versus less intensive interventions or neuromodulation versus sham during tetraplegia rehabilitation. Further multicentre studies of high methodological quality are required to reduce uncertainty about the efficacy of these interventions.",0

Five interventions also addressed cultural deep structure dimensions by providing culturally congruent counsellors or educators, or incorporating Chinese cultural values and social customs. Six interventions resulted in significant improvements in major outcome variables. Participants also reported high satisfaction and retention rates were high.Conclusion: Culturally-tailored interventions that incorporate surface and deep structural elements of culture are sensitive and generally effective for Chinese Americans to improve access to health care, disease awareness, social environment, and participants' ability to practice self-management skills.",0
https://doi.org/10.1016/j.envres.2020.109305,"Health effects of living near an incinerator: A systematic review of epidemiological studies, with focus on last generation plants","Huge reductions in incinerators' emissions occurred over time, and results of older studies cannot be directly generalized to modern plants. We conducted a systematic review of the epidemiologic evidence of the health effects of incinerators, classifying plants in three generations, according to emission limits. A systematic search identified 63 epidemiologic studies, published in English, investigating health effects of incinerators on humans. We focused on cancer, cardio-cerebrovascular diseases (CVD) and respiratory diseases, pregnancy outcomes and congenital anomalies. Only six studies in the general population were on third generation incinerators providing data on pregnancy outcomes and congenital anomalies. Given the heterogeneity of methods, the abundance of ecological/semi-ecological studies and the lack of reliable quantitative measures of exposure in several studies we did not perform any meta-analysis. No excesses emerged concerning all cancers and lung cancer. An excess of non-Hodgkin lymphoma was reported in some earlier studies, but not for second generation plants. Possible excesses of soft tissue sarcomas were confined to earlier incinerators and the areas closer to the plants. No clear association emerged for CVD and diseases of the respiratory system. Several different pregnancy outcomes were considered, and no consistent association emerged, in spite of a few positive results. Studies were negative for congenital anomalies as a whole. Sporadic excesses were reported in a few studies for specific types of anomalies, but no consistent pattern emerged. Evaluation of the evidence was hindered by heterogeneity in reporting and classification of outcomes across studies. Direct evidence from third generation plants is scarce. Methodological issues in study design (mainly related to exposure assessment, confounding and ecological design) and analysis make interpretation of results complex. In spite of this, the overall evidence suggests that, if there were any excesses at all for older incinerators, they were modest at most. Additional monitoring of third generation plants needs to overcome methodological weaknesses.",1

However, these studies have shown conflicting results. Objective To analyze the association between psoriasis and CD. Methods We conducted a systematic review of the case-control, cross-sectional, and cohort studies examining the association between psoriasis and CD in the PubMed, Scopus, and Cochrane databases. The adjusted effect sizes or crude data were extracted for quantitative analysis. Results Of 754 citations initially identified, 18 studies were included. Random effects meta-analysis found significant odds ratios of 2.16 (95% confidence interval, 1.74-2.69; 9 studies) for CD in patients with psoriasis and 1.8 (95% confidence interval, 1.36-2.38; 8 studies) for psoriasis in patients with CD. We also found a significantly increased risk of new-onset psoriasis in CD (hazard ratio, 1.75; 95% confidence interval, 1.58-1.93). Subgroup analyses according to disease severity and geographic region could not be performed due to limited data. Conclusion This 2-way meta-analysis found a significant association between psoriasis and CD. Clinicians should be aware of this association. Patients with psoriasis with bowel complaints might benefit from screening for CD through questionnaires or interviews with subsequent gastroenterology consultation.",0

We thus conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to report the prevalence and prognostic and clinicopathological value of programmed cell death ligand 1 (PD-L1) and programmed cell death-legend 2 (PD-L2) in RCC patients.The PubMed, Cochrane Library, EMBASE databases were searched to find human studies limited to English language literature published through October 1, 2019. Using random or fixed effects models, hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were evaluated to explore the prognostic value of PD-Ls expression, while odds ratios (ORs) and 95% CIs were evaluated to investigate clinicopathological parameters. The protocol of the study was registered in PROSPERO (CRD42019135199).After pooling all 16 eligible studies comprising 3,389 patients, we found that the overall prevalence of PD-L1 and PD-L2 in RCC patients was 27% and 39%, respectively. Furthermore, PD-L1 over-expression was a strong negative predictor for overall survival (OS), disease-free survival/progression-free survival (DFS/PFS), and cancer-specific survival (CSS) in renal cell carcinoma patients (HR =2.86, 95% CI: 1.83-4.47, P<0.001; HR =2.64, 95% CI: 1.99-3.52, P<0.001; HR =2.78, 95% CI: 2.17-3.56, P<0.001). Meanwhile, PD-L2 over-expression was only a weak negative predictor for CSS (HR =1.66, 95% CI: 1.05-2.65, P<0.05). Subgroup analysis showed that Caucasians had worse OS (HR =3.60, 95% CI: 1.77-7.33, P<0.001), PFS (HR =3.56, 95% CI: 2.44-5.18, P<0.001), and CSS (HR =3.13, 95% CI: 2.37-4.14, P<0.001) than Asians. PD-L1 was a strong indicator for worse prognosis (P<0.05 for all), while PD-L2 over-expression was only associated with sarcomatoid features (presence vs. absence, OR =1.80, 95% CI: 1.13-2.86, P=0.014). Notably, PD-L1 overexpression was more prevalent in women (male vs. female, OR =0.68, 95% CI: 0.51-0.90, P=0.006).Higher PD-L1 expression is more closely associated with poor prognosis and more advanced clinicopathological features in RCC patients than PD-L2, especially in women and Caucasian patients. PD-L2 was a weak negative predictor of poor CSS of RCC and was not a prompt for the metastasis of RCC.",0

Social exclusion, which can take many forms, increases the risk of self-harm and suicidal ideation. One important marker of social exclusion in young people is school absenteeism. Whether school absenteeism is associated with these adverse outcomes, and if so to what extent, remains unclear. To determine the association between school absenteeism and both self-harm (including completed suicide) and suicidal ideation in children and adolescents, we conducted a systematic review of observational studies. We conducted meta-analysis and report a narrative synthesis where this was not possible. Meta-analysis of cross-sectional studies showed that school absenteeism was associated with an increased risk of self-harm [pooled adjusted odds ratio (aOR) 1.37, 95% confidence interval 1.20-1.57, P = 0.01] and of suicidal ideation (pooled aOR 1.20, 95% CI 1.02-1.42, P = 0.03). A small number of studies showed that school absenteeism had a longitudinal association with both adverse outcomes. Heterogeneity in the exposure and outcome variables, study design and reporting was prominent and limited the extent to which it was appropriate to pool results. School absenteeism was associated with both self-harm and suicidal ideation in young people, but this evidence was derived from a small number of cross-sectional studies. Further research into the mechanisms of this association could help to inform self-harm and suicide prevention strategies at clinical, school and population levels.",0
https://doi.org/10.1002/aur.2264,Beyond intervention into daily life: A systematic review of generalisation following social communication interventions for young children with autism,"Researchers have generally considered autistic individuals to have difficulties generalising learned skills across novel contexts. Successful generalisation is necessary for an intervention to have benefits in everyday life beyond the original learning environment. We conducted a systematic review of randomised controlled trials of early social communication interventions for children with autism in order to explore generalisation and its measurement. We identified nine RCTs that provided evidence of initial target learning and measured generalisation, of which eight demonstrated at least some successful generalisation across people, settings, and/or activities. The findings did not support the widely reported generalisation 'difficulties' associated with autism. However, generalisation was not consistent across all skills within studies, and one study found no generalisation despite evidence for initial target learning within the intervention context. In general, there are few methodologically sound social communication intervention studies exploring generalisation in autism and no consensus on how it should be measured. In particular, failure to demonstrate initial learning of target skills within the intervention setting and an absence of formal mediation analyses of the hypothesised mechanisms limit current research. We outline a framework within which measurement of generalisation can be considered for use in future trials. To maximise the effectiveness of interventions, the field needs to gain a better understanding of the nature of generalisation among autistic individuals and what additional strategies may further enhance learning. Autism Res 2020, 13: 506-522. © 2020 The Authors. Autism Research published by International Society for Autism Research published by Wiley Periodicals, Inc. LAY SUMMARY: It is generally considered that autistic individuals experience difficulties applying things they have learned in one context into different settings (e.g. from school to home). This is important to consider for intervention studies. Our review does not support a complete lack of generalisation but instead suggests that after early social communication intervention, autistic children can transfer some skills to new contexts. Overall, there is limited research in this area and further work is needed.",0

Design The design of this study involved a structured review and meta-analysis. Methods Evaluation of randomised controlled trials of exercise-based cardiac rehabilitation in HFrEF-patients with left ventricular ejection fraction ≤40% of any aetiology with a follow-up of ≥6 months published in 1999 or later. Results Out of 12,229 abstracts, 25 randomised controlled trials including 4481 HFrEF-patients were included in the final evaluation. Heterogeneity in study population, study design and exercise-based cardiac rehabilitation-intervention was evident. No significant difference in the effect of exercise-based cardiac rehabilitation on mortality compared to control-group was found (hazard ratio 0.75, 95% confidence interval 0.39–1.41, four studies; 12-months follow-up: relative risk 1.29, 95% confidence interval 0.66–2.49, eight studies; six-months follow-up: relative risk 0.91, 95% confidence interval 0.26–3.16, seven studies). In addition there was no significant difference between the groups with respect to ‘hospitalization-for-any-reason’ (12-months follow-up: relative risk 0.79, 95% confidence interval 0.41–1.53, four studies), or ‘hospitalization-due-to-heart-failure’ (12-months follow-up: relative risk 0.59, 95% confidence interval 0.12–2.91, four studies; six-months follow-up: relative risk 0.84, 95% confidence interval 0.07–9.71, three studies). All studies show improvement of exercise capacity. Participation in exercise-based cardiac rehabilitation significantly improved quality-of-life as evaluated with the Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire: (six-months follow-up: mean difference 1.94, 95% confidence interval 0.35–3.56, two studies), but no significant results emerged for quality-of-life measured by the Minnesota Living with Heart Failure Questionnaire (nine-months or more follow-up: mean difference –4.19, 95% confidence interval –10.51–2.12, seven studies; six-months follow-up: mean difference –5.97, 95% confidence interval –16.17–4.23, four studies). Conclusion No association between exercise-based cardiac rehabilitation and mortality or hospitalisation could be observed in HFrEF patients but exercise-based cardiac rehabilitation is likely to improve exercise capacity and quality of life.",0
https://doi.org/10.1016/j.hpb.2019.12.001,A systematic review and network meta-analysis of phase III randomised controlled trials for adjuvant therapy following resection of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC),"Several randomised controlled trials (RCTs) have reported various systemic adjuvant therapy regimens following resection of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). The most commonly applied include modified FOLFRINOX (mFFX), Gemcitabine/Capecitabine (GemCap) and S1, usually compared to gemcitabine (Gem) alone. However, many of these regimens have not been directly compared in RCTs. This network meta-analysis aims to characterise the impact of adjuvant therapies on overall and disease-free survival in patients having resection of PDAC.A systematic review was conducted using MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane Central and American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) abstracts to identify published phase III RCTs articles up to 9th May 2019 that examined adjuvant systemic therapy in resected pancreatic cancer. Data including study characteristics and outcomes including overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS) were extracted. Indirect comparisons of all regimens were simultaneously compared using random-effects network meta-analyses (NMA) which maintains randomisation within trials.Twelve phase III RCTs involving 4947 patients and nine different regimens (5-Flourouracil/Folinic acid (5-FU/FA), Gemcitabine, Gemcitabine/Erlotinib (GemErl), GemCap), mFFX, S1, chemoradiotherapy (CRT), CRT with either 5-FU or Gemcitabine) were identified. S1 was ranked best for overall and disease-free survival followed by mFFX. Whilst there were no significant difference between S1 and mFFX for overall survival (mean difference: 1.6 months, p = 0.8), S1 had significantly longer disease-free survival than mFFX (mean difference: 2.8 months, p < 0.001). Furthermore, S1 was ranked best for lowest overall and haematological grade 3/4 toxicities.This network meta-analysis demonstrates that chemotherapy with S1 or mFFX is superior to GemCap for adjuvant treatment for PDAC, improves survival after surgical resection and should be considered as reasonable standard treatment options in the adjuvant setting and as control arm for future adjuvant clinical trials.",0

https://doi.org/10.1186/s13643-020-01331-8,Attachment and relationship-based interventions for families during neonatal intensive care hospitalization: a study protocol for a systematic review and meta-analysis,"Abstract Background Attachment in the parent-infant dyads is fundamental for growth and development of children born prematurely. However, the natural process of attachment is interrupted just after preterm birth, and emotional and physical detachment, limited social interaction, and a traumatic, technologically heavy environment in a neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) may result in impaired attachment or bonding. To our knowledge, few studies have evaluated the effectiveness of interventions aimed at enhancing attachment, bonding, and relationships between parents and their preterm infants during the infant’s hospitalization in the NICU. This study aims to perform a comprehensive systematic review and a meta-analysis survey of the effects of attachment- and relationship-based interventions in the NICU. Method A comprehensive literature review will be conducted in the following databases: MEDLINE, CINAHL, PubMed, EMBASE (OVID), Scopus, PsycINFO (OVID), Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), and Web of Science. Selected studies will be published in English, in the last 20 years, from 1999 onwards. All studies of randomized controlled trials (e.g., parallel groups, cluster) will be included. We will consider studies evaluating attachment- and relationship-based interventions (e.g., skin-to-skin contact, parental involvement in infant care) versus a comparator (standard of care). The primary outcome will be maternal attachment. Secondary outcomes will include infants’ growth and development, family health, and parenting experience. Data extraction from eligible studies will be conducted independently by two experts who will compare their data. The Cochrane risk of bias tool will be applied to the selected studies. If data permits, we will conduct random effects meta-analysis where appropriate. Subgroup and additional analyses will be conducted to explore the potential sources of heterogeneity considering gender of parents, infants’ sex, and gestational age. Data synthesis will be carried out using the RevMan 5.3 software. Publication bias will be assessed with the graphical funnel plot method and the Egger test. The quality of the evidence will be rated using the methods of the Grades of Recommendation Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) Working Group. Discussion The results of this systematic review will discuss the types of attachment- or relationship-based interventions that are effective for facilitating family health outcomes and the babies’ growth and development and will contribute to establishing new evidence in neonatal and family-centered care by providing scientific guidance for clinical practice and further research.

Our aim was to compare the emerging technique of single-incision laparoscopic surgery complete mesocolic excision (SILS CME) colectomy with the standard multiport laparoscopic CME (MPL CME) colectomy. Methods. MEDLINE (PubMed), Scopus, EMBASE, Ovid, and the Cochrane library were searched. Studies comparing the SILS CME with MPL CME in adults with colon adenocarcinoma were included. The Jadad and Newcastle Ottawa Scales were used to critically appraise the studies. The presence of statistical heterogeneity or publication bias was examined. Results. Seven studies (3 randomized) with a total number of 1344 patients were included (546 SILS CME and 798 MPL CME). No difference was found in anastomotic leakage (odds ratio [OR] = 0.79 [0.31 to 2.03]; P = .63), number of lymph nodes (weighted mean difference [WMD] = 0.85 [−0.97 to 2.66]; P = .36), hospital stay (WMD = 0.01 [−0.19 to 0.20]; P = .96), overall survival (hazard ratio [HR] = 1.19 [0.29 to 4.80]; P = .81), and disease-free survival (HR = 1.30 [0.30 to 5.61]; P = .72). Skin incision was shorter in SILS CME group (WMD = −3.02 [−3.25 to −2.80]; P &lt; .00001) but with no difference in pain reported in postoperative day 1 (standardized mean difference [SMD] = −0.21 [−0.50 to 0.09]; P = .17) or day 2 (SMD = 0.16 [−0.52 to 0.84]; P = .64). Conclusions. SILS CME, although technically more demanding, has equivalent short- and long-term outcomes when compared with MPL CME.

We reviewed the evidence to address the research question: Does acute exposure to shift work impact (blunt) the natural drop (dip) in Blood Pressure (BP) occurring during sleep and/or nighttime hours? (PROSPERO CRD42018110847). Methods: We performed a systematic review of five databases. We compared pooled estimates of mean BP stratified by periods of shift work, rest/leisure, and sleep, and evaluated the quality of evidence with the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) framework. Results: Our search covered 1/1/1980-10/24/2018 and yielded 1,636 records. Inter-rater agreement during screening was high (Kappa=0.87). We retained 44 studies described in 50 publications. We identified wide variation in shift worker type, shift schedules, and regularity of BP measurements. Most studies examined BP during one shift workday and one rest/leisure day. No study examined the impact of repeated exposure to shift work on the sleep-related dip in BP. Eighteen studies examined night shifts and one reported on BP during sleep post night shift. Compared to BP measured during shift work, BP measured during any sleep period separate from shift work was lower by 17.5 mmHg Systolic BP (95%CI 15.75, 19.27) and 15.4 mmHg lower for Diastolic BP (95%CI 14.38, 16.42) ( p < 0.05). Conclusions: There is limited research exploring the acute and long-term impact of shift work on BP during sleep. The available evidence is heterogenous, low quality, and suggests that the mean dip in BP during sleep separate from shift work is not blunted.",1

Hepatitis E virus (HEV) infection is an important emerging health issue in these patients. To date, numerous studies have investigated the seroprevalence of HEV among HD patients across the world; however, the data are conflicting. The present study aimed to measure the exposure rate of HD patients to HEV infection by estimating the overall seroprevalence of HEV in this high-risk group. A systematic literature search was carried out using five electronic databases from inception to January 10, 2020, with standard keywords. Pooled seroprevalence estimates with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated using a random intercept logistic regression model. The seroprevalence of HEV increased from 6.6% between the years of 1994 and 2000 to 11.13% from 2016 to 2020. Blood transfusion was associated with a nearly 2-fold increase in the rate of HEV seropositivity (OR = 1.99; 95% CI: 1.50-2.63, P < .0001, I2 = 6.5%). HEV seroprevalence among patients with HD for more than 60 months was significantly higher than those with HD for less than 60 months (27.69%, 95% CI: 20.69%-35.99% vs 15.78%, 95%CI: 8.85%-26.57%, respectively) (P = .06). Our results indicated increased exposure of HD patients with HEV infection over the last decade. We concluded that blood transfusion and duration of HD are considerable risk factors for acquiring HEV infection among HD patients.",0

This systematic review and meta-analysis estimate the pooled prevalence and risk factors for mental health problems among police personnel worldwide. Three independent reviewers searched 16 databases and screened 11 506 articles published between January 1980 and October 2019. Eligible studies involved at least 100 active police professionals and used validated instruments to ascertain specific mental health problems. Estimates were pooled using random-effects meta-analyses. In total, 60 cross-sectional and seven longitudinal studies, involving 272 463 police personnel from 24 countries met criteria for inclusion. The overall pooled point prevalence was 14.6% for depression (95% CI 10.9% to 18.6%), 14.2% for post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD; 95% CI 10.3% to 18.7%), 9.6% for a generalised anxiety disorder (95% CI 6.7% to 12.9%), 8.5% for suicidal ideation (95% CI 6.1% to 11.2%), 5.0% for alcohol dependence (95% CI 3.5% to 6.7%) and 25.7% for hazardous drinking (95% CI 19.6% to 32.4%). The strongest risk factor for depression and suicidal ideation was higher occupational stress, and the strongest risk factors for PTSD were higher occupational stress and avoidant coping strategies. Higher levels of peer-support were associated with significantly lower PTSD symptoms. Our findings suggest that the prevalence of mental health problems among police exceeds twice that previously reported in mixed samples of first responders, and is associated with poor social support, occupational stress and maladaptive coping strategies. Without effective intervention, psychological difficulties will remain a substantial health concern among police.",0

Because no summative assessment of these prospective trials exists to date, we systematically reviewed the outcomes and toxicities associated with therapy de-intensification for this population. PRISMA-guided systematic PubMed searches (along with articles known to the authors and references thereof) were performed for prospective studies reporting clinical outcomes and/or toxicities of de-intensified RT and/or systemic therapy (with or without surgery), exclusively for HPV-associated OPC. Ten prospective studies were analyzed. Performing a meta-analysis was not entirely possible owing to the heterogeneity of treatment paradigms and the lack of >2 studies for most paradigms; however, because just one paradigm (induction chemotherapy followed by reduced-dose RT and/or systemic therapy) had 4 associated articles, an exploratory meta-analysis was conducted for that subset. Two trials of dose-reduced concurrent chemoradiotherapy (60 Gy/weekly cisplatin) demonstrated 3-year distant metastasis-free survival and overall survival (OS) ranging from 91 to 100% and 95%, respectively; acute grade 3+ mucositis and dysphagia occurred in 33–35% and 21–39%, respectively. In the four trials of induction chemotherapy (platinum/taxane-based) followed by dose-reduced RT, 2-year progression-free and OS ranged from 80 to 95% and 83 to 98%, respectively; acute grade 3+ dysphagia, dermatitis, and mucositis ranged from 9 to 15%, 7 to 20%, and 9 to 30% (excluding one outlier), respectively. For these four trials, the exploratory meta-analysis showed a pooled 2-year PFS and OS of 89% (95% confidence interval, 80–96%) and 96% (92–99%). The pooled rates of grade ≥3 dysphagia, dermatitis, and mucositis were 13% (7–19%), 9% (5–14%), and 28% (9–53%). However, there was significant heterogeneity in the 2-year PFS (I2 = 57%, p = 0.07) and grade ≥3 mucositis (I2 90%, p",0

The term “smart city” has been used synonymously with other terms, such as “digital city”, “sustainable city”, and “information city”, even though definitional distinctions exist between terms. In this review, we use “smart cities” as a catch-all term to refer to an emerging concept in urban governance practice and scholarship that has been increasingly applied to achieve public health aims. The objective of this systematic review was to document and analyze the inclusion of equity considerations and dimensions (i.e., a measurement, analytical, or dialectical focus on systematic disparities in health between groups) in smart city interventions aimed to improve human health and well-being. Systematic searches were carried out in the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL), Psychological Information Database (PsycINFO), the PubMed database from the National Center for Biotechnology Information, Elsevier’s database Scopus, and Web of Science, returning 3219 titles. Ultimately, 28 articles were retained, assessed, and coded for their inclusion of equity characteristics using the Cochrane PROGRESS-Plus tool (referring to (P) place of residence, (R) race, (O) occupation, (G) gender, (R) religion, (E) education, (S) socio-economic status (SES), and (S) social capital). The most frequently included equity considerations in smart city health interventions were place of residence, SES, social capital, and personal characteristics; conversely, occupation, gender or sex, religion, race, ethnicity, culture, language, and education characteristics were comparatively less featured in such interventions. Overall, it appears that most of intervention evaluations assessed in this review are still in the early testing phases, and thus did not include or feature robust evaluative designs or commercially available technologies",0

However, findings from trials vary substantially across studies. Therefore, current meta-analysis aimed to examine the effects of L-Carnitine supplementation on exercise-induced muscle damage. An electronic search of the online literature databases (Medline (PubMed), Scopus and Google Scholar) was performed up to November 2018. Either a fixed-effects model or a random-effects model (Diasorin-Liard) was used in order to estimate the effects size. Cochran's Q test and I2 tests were used to assess the heterogeneity among the studies. Funnel plot and Egger's regression test were also employed in order to assess the publication bias. Of 604 studies, seven eligible randomized controlled trials (RCTs) were included in this meta-analysis. Pooled data from seven studies showed that L-Carnitine resulted in significant improvements in muscle soreness (MS) at the five follow-up time points (0, 24, 48, 72 and 96 hours (h)) compared to placebo. Also, pooled data indicated that L-Carnitine significantly reduced creatine kinase (CK), myoglobin (Mb), and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) levels at one follow-up period (24 h). However, no effects have been observed beyond this period. Our outcomes indicate that L-Carnitine supplementation improves delayed-onset muscle soreness (DOMS) and markers of muscle damage. Further research is needed to clarify impacts of L-Carnitine on DOMS after different types of mechanical or chemical damages.Key teaching pointsThe effect of L-Carnitine supplementation on exercise-induced muscle damage has come under scrutiny over many years.This systematic review and meta-analyses study investigated the effects of L-Carnitine supplementation on exercise-induced muscle damage.Overall, summary results indicate that L-Carnitine supplementation improves muscle soreness and markers of muscle damage (CK, LDH, and Mb).Overall, L-carnitine supplementation ameliorated muscle damage only in resistance training groups and untrained population.",0

They have comparable efficacy in virologic response, but their effect on the development of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in CHB is controversial. Therefore, we aimed to compare TDF and ETV evaluating the risk of HCC development in CHB patients. &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Methods:&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; A systematic literature search was conducted up to November 2019 in MEDLINE/PubMed, SCOPUS, and Web of Science databases without language and time restrictions. DerSimonian and Laird random-effects models were used to estimate combined hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% CIs. &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Results:&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; Seven studies containing 35,785 participants were included in this systematic review and meta-analysis. The pooled HR (95% CI) of HCC in the patients who used TDF versus patients who used ETV was 0.75 (0.56–0.96). There was no significant heterogeneity detected among the included studies results (&lt;i&gt;I&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 47.5%).

Aside from occupational exposures and smoking, diet is the main source of exposure in humans. We performed a systematic review of the association between estimated dietary intake of acrylamide and risk of female breast, endometrial, and ovarian cancers in nonexperimental studies published through February 25, 2020, and conducted a dose–response meta-analysis. We identified 18 papers covering 10 different study populations: 16 cohort and two case–control studies. Acrylamide intake was associated with a slightly increased risk of ovarian cancer, particularly among never smokers. For endometrial cancer, risk was highest at intermediate levels of exposure, whereas the association was more linear and positive among never smokers. For breast cancer, we found evidence of a null or inverse relation between exposure and risk, particularly among never smokers and postmenopausal women. In a subgroup analysis limited to premenopausal women, breast cancer risk increased linearly with acrylamide intake starting at 20 μg/day of intake. High acrylamide intake was associated with increased risks of ovarian and endometrial cancers in a relatively linear manner, especially among never smokers. Conversely, little association was observed between acrylamide intake and breast cancer risk, with the exception of premenopausal women.",1

To date, its use is limited to a few centers around the world, and there has been no attempt to systematically evaluate survival and toxicity outcomes reported in the literature. Correspondingly, the aim of this study was to qualitatively and quantitatively assess these outcomes. A systematic search of seven electronic databases from inception to November 2019 was conducted following PRISMA guidelines. Articles were screened against pre-specified criteria. Outcomes were then pooled by random-effects meta-analyses of proportions. A total of nine studies provided unique metadata for assessment, with six originating from Heidelberg, Germany. The surveyed cohort size was 632 patients, with 389 (62%) chordomas and 243 (38%) chondrosarcomas of the skull base. Across all studies, median cohort age at therapy and female proportion were 46 years and 51% respectively. Estimates of local control incidence at 1-, 5-, and 10-years in chordoma-only studies were 99%, 80%, and 56%, and in chondrosarcoma-only studies were 99%, 89%, and 88%. Estimates of overall survival probability at 1-, 5-, and 10-years in chordoma-only studies were 100%, 94%, and 78%, and in chondrosarcoma-only studies were 99%, 95%, and 79%. The incidence of early and late toxicity (Grade ≥ 3) ranged from 0 to 4% across all study groups. The emerging use of CIRT to treat skull base chordomas and chondrosarcomas appear promising with regard to tumor control, overall survival, and risk profile of early and late toxicity. The current literature suffers from the fact only a few centers in the world currently employ this technology.",0
https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jad.2020.03.005,"Parental bipolar disorder, family environment, and offspring psychiatric disorders: A systematic review","Abstract Background Our objective was to systematically review non-experimental studies of parental bipolar disorder (BD), current family environment, and offspring psychiatric disorders to identify characteristics of family environment associated with parental BD and risk for offspring psychiatric disorders. Methods CINAHL, Embase, PsycINFO, and PubMed were searched using MeSH terms to identify studies on offspring of BD parents published through September 2017. We followed PRISMA guidelines and used the Risk of Bias Assessment Tool for Nonrandomized Studies (RoBANS). We calculated prevalence ratios and 95% confidence intervals to compare offspring psychiatric disorders within and across studies. Results Of 10,454 unique documents retrieved, we included 13 studies. The most consistent finding was lower parent-reported cohesion in families with a BD parent versus no parental psychiatric disorders. Family environment did not differ between BD parents and parents with other disorders. Offspring of BD parents had higher prevalence of psychiatric disorders than offspring of parents without psychiatric disorders but did not differ from offspring of parents with other disorders. Families with a BD child had higher conflict than families without a BD child. Limitations Comparisons between studies were qualitative. A single reviewer conducted screening, data extraction, and bias assessment. Conclusions Family environment in families with a BD parent is heterogeneous. The pattern of findings across studies also suggests that family problems may be associated with parental psychiatric illness generally rather than parental BD in particular. Few studies included offspring-reported measures. Given the association of family conflict with offspring mood disorders, further study is merited on children's perceptions of the family environment in the BD high-risk context.",0

A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis,"Abstract The systemic inflammatory response plays a role in tumor progression and development. The neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio (NLR) is a biochemical marker of systemic inflammation and is increasingly gaining appreciation for its prognostic role in predicting breast cancer outcomes. Previous research has demonstrated that patients who achieve a complete pathologic response (pCR) to neoadjuvant breast cancer treatment have a more favorable disease-free survival. This study aimed to assess whether the NLR can predict pCR to neoadjuvant therapy in breast cancer. A meta-analysis of 8 relevant studies was performed. The primary endpoint included pCR. Secondary endpoint included 5-year disease-free survival. Eight studies were included, reporting on 1586 patients. A total of 363 (22.88%) patients achieved pCR post neoadjuvant therapy. A lower NLR was associated with a greater rate of pCR (odds ratio, 1.83; 95% confidence interval, 1.15-2.91; P = .0003). Only 4 studies produced data on disease-free survival. A lower NLR was associated with a higher 5-year disease-free survival; however, this did not achieve statistical significance (hazard ratio, 1.38; 95% confidence interval, 0.82-2.31; P = .02). Sub-group analysis of sample size, NLR value, and geographic location proved statistically significant in determining an association between NLR and pCR. This meta-analysis found NLR to be a predictor for pCR in patients with breast cancer. All of the studies reviewed were retrospective cohort studies. Adequately sized, prospective clinical trials are needed to understand if NLR could become an important prognostic indicator of pCR.",0
https://doi.org/10.3390/jcm9040984,Wound Lavage in Studies on Vital Pulp Therapy of Permanent Teeth with Carious Exposures: A Qualitative Systematic Review,"The aim of this study was to systematically review pulp wound lavage in vital pulp therapy (VPT). A search was conducted in six life science databases to identify clinical trials carried out on permanent teeth with a carious pulp exposure and a recall interval of at least six months. Twenty-seven trials of low to moderate risk of bias (RoB-2 and ROBINS-I) were included. Data was extracted and analyzed regarding study characteristics and methods used for pulp wound lavage. The agent used for pulp wound lavage was specified in all included trials. Most of the identified trials (23/27) randomized the pulp capping material. Many (14/27) reported the use of sodium hypochlorite (NaOCl); ten used only saline or water. One trial was identified that compared pulp wound lavage with 2.5% (NaOCl) to saline, another compared 5% glutaraldehyde to water, both in immature molar pulpotomies. Both studies were underpowered. Neither showed a significant difference between treatments. The use of NaOCl was positively correlated to recent year of publication and use of hydraulic calcium silicate cements for pulp capping (p &lt; 0.05). In conclusion, despite a lack of well-designed trials on pulp wound lavage in VPT, a trend towards using NaOCl for this purpose was observed.",0

This systematic review aimed to summarize studies on micro-environmental choice architecture interventions that encouraged physical activity or discouraged sedentary behavior in adults, and to describe the effectiveness of those interventions on these behaviors – and on related intentions or health outcomes – in presence of the intervention and after removal of the intervention (i.e. post-intervention, regardless of the time elapsed). Methods We systematically searched PubMed, Embase, PsycINFO and the Cochrane Library for (quasi) experimental studies published up to December 2019 that evaluated the effect of choice architecture interventions on physical activity and sedentary behavior, as well as on intentions and health outcomes related to physical activity/sedentary behavior. Studies that combined choice architecture techniques with other behavior change techniques were excluded. All studies were screened for eligibility, relevant data was extracted and two independent reviewers assessed the methodological quality using the QualSyst tool. Results Of the 9609 records initially identified, 88 studies met our eligibility criteria. Most studies ( n = 70) were of high methodologic quality. Eighty-six studies targeted physical activity, predominantly stair use, whereas two studies targeted sedentary behavior, and one targeted both behaviors. Intervention techniques identified were prompting ( n = 53), message framing ( n = 24), social comparison ( n = 12), feedback ( n = 8), default change (n = 1) and anchoring (n = 1). In presence of the intervention, 68% of the studies reported an effect of choice architecture on behavior, whereas after removal of the intervention only 47% of the studies reported a significant effect. For all choice architecture techniques identified, except for message framing, the majority of studies reported a significant effect on behavioral intentions or behavior in presence of the intervention. Conclusions The results suggest that prompting can effectively encourage stair use in adults, especially in presence of a prompt. The effectiveness of the choice architecture techniques social influence, feedback, default change and anchoring cannot be assessed based on this review. More (controlled) studies are needed to assess the (sustained) effectiveness of choice architecture interventions on sedentary behavior and other types of physical activity than stair use.",0

Studies involving only recurrent nasopharyngeal patients with cancer were excluded.A total of 17 studies involving 1635 patients were included. Fourteen (82%) of those were retrospective, and 15 (88%) were from single institution. Reirradiation with IMRT produced pooled 2-year LC and OS rates of 52% (95% confidence interval [CI], 46%-57%) and 46% (95% CI, 41%-50%), respectively. In subgroup analyses, the rate of salvage surgery (<42% vs ≥42%) influenced the pooled 2-year LC rate (45.9% vs 58.5%, P = .011). The pooled rates of late grade ≥ 3 and grade 5 toxicities were 26% (95% CI, 20%-32%) and 3.1% (95% CI, 2%-5%), respectively.Reirradiation with IMRT was an effective modality compared to historical outcomes in the pre-IMRT era.",0

Randomized controlled trials of adult end-stage renal-disease individuals receiving either hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis were eligible. Trials were restricted to those which had administered a prebiotic, probiotic, or synbiotic as an oral supplement. Primary outcomes were measures of circulating endotoxin, indoxyl-sulphate, and p-cresyl sulfate.Twenty-one trials were eligible (1152 randomized participants), of which 16 trials were considered to have a high risk of bias. The number of trials available for meta-analysis varied for each primary outcome. Synthesized data indicated that supplementation significantly reduced circulating levels of endotoxin (standardized mean difference, -0.61; 95% confidence interval, -1.03 to -0.20; P = .004; I2 = 0%), indoxyl-sulphate (-0.34; -0.64 to -0.04; P = .02; I2 = 0%), and p-cresyl sulfate (-0.34; -0.61 to -0.07; P = .01; I2 = 0%). For secondary outcomes, supplementation significantly reduced gastrointestinal symptoms (-0.54; -1.02 to -0.07; P = .02; I2 = 0%).Supplementation reduces toxic metabolites associated with cardiovascular disease and mortality in individuals receiving dialysis.

Previous synthesis research results describe the potential negative impact of mobility programs on the physical and mental health of youth. The current systematic review aims to expand our knowledge of the effects of living in a public housing development and leaving public housing and moving to a new neighborhood on youth risk behaviors, including both general crime/delinquency and substance use, sexual risk behavior, behavioral problems, and binge drinking. The systematic review process produced 7 primary research studies on public housing effects and 10 research studies on resettlement effects. Regarding public housing effects, five studies found a higher incidence of youth risk behaviors in public housing areas, while two studies concluded that not all children and adolescents living in public housing areas are adversely affected by the local environment. Of the 10 studies on the effects of relocation from public housing to other areas, 2 non-randomized controlled trial (RCT) studies found negative impacts, but 8 RCT studies found diversity in relocation effects on youth risk behaviors. These results highlight the need for tailored services for relocated youth taking into consideration their gender, age, family characteristics, and relocation sites. No studies on diversification housing projects satisfied the inclusion criteria in the current systematic review. With a thorough examination of the literature and a discussion of implications, a clear path for future inquiry and youth interventions is presented.",0

However, the overall magnitude, trend, and environmental drivers of GHG fluxes in these wetlands of China remain uncertain. Herein, we synthesized data from 70 publications involving 187 field observations to identify patterns and drivers of GHG fluxes across coastal wetlands in China. Average methane (CH4), nitrous oxide (N2O) fluxes, and carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions (ecosystem respiration) across coastal wetlands were estimated as 2.20±0.31 mg·m-2·h-1, 16.44±2.96 μg·m-2·h-1, and 388.76±42.28 mg·m-2·h-1, respectively. GHG emissions varied with tidal inundation, where CH4 and CO2 emissions during tidal inundation were lower than during ebbing. CH4 and CO2 emissions from wetlands decreased linearly with increasing latitude, while N2O did not. CH4 fluxes were positively related to air temperature and aboveground biomass, and CO2 emissions were positively related to soil organic carbon. N2O fluxes were lower with increasing soil pH, and CH4 and CO2 emissions were greater with increasing soil moisture. Based on the results of sustained-flux global warming potential and sustained-flux global cooling potential models, our paper indicate that the fluxes of CH4 and N2O in coastal wetlands have a positive feedback to global warming, which is mainly driven by the CH4 emission. Our synthesis improved understanding of the roles of coastal wetlands in the ecosystem C cycle under global change. We suggest that long-term field observations of GHG fluxes across a wider range of spatiotemporal scales are urgently required to improve the prediction accuracy in GHG fluxes and the assessment of net GHG balance and its contribution to the GWP of coastal wetlands.",0

Additionally, the same surveillance interval is recommended for patients with ≤2 diminutive NAAs and those with ≤2 small NAAs. However, it is questionable whether these recommendations are appropriate. Methods We searched all relevant studies published through September 2019 that examined the risk of metachronous advanced colorectal neoplasia (ACRN) according to the size (diminutive vs small) and the number of adenomas found during an index colonoscopy. Low-risk adenomas (LRAs) were subclassified into 2 categories (LRA-1, ≤2 diminutive NAAs; and LRA-2, ≤2 small NAAs), and high-risk adenomas (HRAs) were subclassified into 3 categories (HRA-1, ≥3 diminutive NAAs; HRA-2, ≥3 small NAAs; and HRA-3, advanced adenoma). Results Eight studies involving 36,142 patients were evaluated. The LRA-2 group had a higher risk of metachronous ACRN than the LRA-1 group (risk ratio, 1.49; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.23-1.81). Additionally, the HRA-2 and HRA-3 groups had a higher risk of metachronous ACRN than the HRA-1 group (hazard ratios [HRs], 1.51 [95% CI, 1.002-2.28] and 1.92 [95% CI, 1.11-3.33], respectively). However, there was no significant difference between the HRA-1 versus LRA-2 groups (HR, 1.23; 95% CI, .78-1.94). Conclusions Among the HRA and LRA groups, those with diminutive NAAs had a lower risk of metachronous ACRN than those with small NAAs. We believe that clinical guidelines should consider extending the surveillance intervals in patients with diminutive NAAs only.",0

Twelve cross-sectional and two ecological studies were included. Fast food outlets were most commonly examined (n = 12). The associations between fast food outlets near schools and obesity were generally positive among Latino, white, and African American students and across grade levels, although the strengths of evidence varied. The directions of association were mixed among Asian children. Three studies reported generally positive associations between convenience stores and obesity among Latino and African American children and mixed associations among white and Asian children. Longitudinal studies are needed in addition to studies examining underlying mechanisms of the differential influence of food environments near schools within each subgroup.",1

The eligible studies included a total of 5,545 NEN patients, with a median of 39 patients per study (range 5–214). Pooled rate of partial response was 36.6% (38.9% achieved stable disease) and 55.2% of patients had a symptomatic response to therapy when pooled data were analysed. The median PFS and OS were 18.4 months (95% CI 15.5–21.2) and 40.7 months (95% CI 35.2–46.2) respectively. The most common toxicities were found to be abdominal pain (48.8%) and nausea (48.1%). Outcome did not significantly vary depending on the type of embolisation performed. &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Conclusion:&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; Liver embolisation provides adequate symptom relief for patients with carcinoid syndrome and is also able to reach partial response in a significant proportion of patients and a reasonable PFS.

STUDY SELECTION: Search terms included vancomycin, body weight, and body composition terms and were limited to children. Studies were reviewed and screened by ≥2 reviewers. DATA EXTRACTION: The primary outcome was vancomycin level. Data were extracted by 2 reviewers. We performed quality assessment using the Newcastle-Ottawa quality assessment scale. RESULTS: We identified 271 records. After abstract and full-text screening, we identified 7 studies for full review. Six of the 7 studies used a matched case-control design, although there was significant variation in study methodology. Four of the 7 studies were included in a meta-analysis, which revealed a small but significant difference in vancomycin trough levels between children with normal weight and children with overweight or obesity when dosed by using TBW (N = 521; mean difference 2.2 U [95% confidence interval: 1.0–3.4]). CONCLUSIONS: High-quality data to guide vancomycin dosing in children with obesity are lacking. More studies evaluating dosing strategies in children with obesity are warranted because using TBW to dose vancomycin may lead to higher vancomycin concentrations and potential toxicity.",0

With better understanding of CLL biology, trends are shifting towards the use of targeted therapies. The objective of this article is to review the safety and efficacy of various novel agents that specifically target the dysregulated pathways, with particular attention to elderly patients. Agents like B-cell receptor (BCR) inhibitors (Bruton's tyrosine kinase inhibitors [ibrutinib]), phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase inhibitors (idelalisib), spleen tyrosine kinase inhibitors (entospletinib), Bcl-2 inhibitors (venetoclax), immunomodulators (lenalidomide), and monoclonal antibodies (obinutuzumab, ofatumumab) have shown activity in CLL with a very favorable toxicity profile. Newer agents have improved clinical outcomes, and have tolerable toxicity profiles in elderly patients, resulting in the treatment with individualized therapy approach for CLL.",0

This study was aimed to identify and quantify studies reporting the diagnostic accuracy of the new generation IRTT in children and to compare the sensitivity and specificity of IRTT under different cutoffs and give the optimal cutoff. Methods Articles were derived from a systematic search in PubMed, Web of Science Core Collection, and Embase, and were assessed for internal validity by the Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies-2 (QUADAS-2). The figure of risk of bias was created by Review Manager 5.3 and data were synthesized by MetaDisc 1.4. Results Twelve diagnostic studies, involving 4639 pediatric patients, were included. The cut-offs varied from 37.0 °C to 38.0 °C among these studies. The cut-off 37.8 °C was with the highest sROC AUC (0.97) and Youden Index (0.83) and was deemed to be the optimal cutoff. Conclusion The optimal cutoff for infrared tympanic thermometers is 37.8 °C. New Generation Tympanic Thermometry is with high diagnostic accuracy in pediatric patients and can be an alternative for fever screening in children.",0

To better understand the health impacts of transportation initiatives, we conducted a systematic review of longitudinal health evaluations involving: a) bus rapid transit (BRT); b) bicycle lanes; c) Open Streets programs; and d) aerial trams/cable cars. We also synthesized systems-based simulation studies of the health-related consequences of walking, bicycling, aerial tram, bus and BRT use. Two reviewers screened 3302 unique titles and abstracts identified through a systematic search of MEDLINE (Ovid), Scopus, TRID and LILACS databases. We included 39 studies: 29 longitudinal evaluations and 10 simulation studies. Five studies focused on low- and middle-income contexts. Of the 29 evaluation studies, 19 focused on single component bicycle lane interventions; the rest evaluated multi-component interventions involving: bicycle lanes (n = 5), aerial trams (n = 1), and combined bicycle lane/BRT systems (n = 4). Bicycle lanes and BRT systems appeared effective at increasing bicycle and BRT mode share, active transport duration, and number of trips using these modes. Of the 10 simulation studies, there were 9 agent-based models and one system dynamics model. Five studies focused on bus/BRT expansions and incentives, three on interventions for active travel, and the rest investigated combinations of public transport and active travel policies. Synergistic effects were observed when multiple policies were implemented, with several studies showing that sizable interventions are required to significantly shift travel mode choices. Our review indicates that bicycle lanes and BRT systems represent promising initiatives for promoting population health. There is also evidence to suggest that synergistic effects might be achieved through the combined implementation of multiple transportation policies. However, more rigorous evaluation and simulation studies focusing on low- and middle-income countries, aerial trams and Open Streets programs, and a more diverse set of health and health equity outcomes is required. This figure represents a word network created by extracting keywords from the paper abstracts included in our systematic review. Each keyword represents a node in the network; its size is proportional to the number of abstracts in which it appears. Keywords are connected if they are found in the same abstract. The colours represent different communities of words as identified using the Louvain method. • Bike lanes and bus rapid transit systems promote physical activity and active travel. • Multi-component interventions can act synergistically to increase active travel. • Few longitudinal health evaluations of aerial trams and open streets programs exist. • Low-and-middle income countries are understudied in the literature.",0

The data within the meta-analysis revealed that several parameters including Jitter, Shimmer, Noise to Harmonic Ratio discriminated best between bulbar lateral sclerosis and healthy controls. On the other hand, significant variations of fundamental frequency were not observed.Conclusion: Acoustic analysis of and articulatory analysis contributes to identification of the earliest signs of bulbar degeneration and allows the identification of changes in parameters for an early detection, for predicting bulbar involvement and the worsening of disease, for targeting specific intervention. Among the parameters, Jitter and Shimmer discriminated better bulbar involvement, they are significantly increased in the patients, on the contrary maximum phonation time is significantly worsened. The careful monitoring of speech symptoms improves diagnostic accuracy and the close cooperation of a multidisciplinary team (physicians as otolaryngologist and physiatrist, speech and language therapists, physiotherapist, dietitians, caregivers, the patients, and their relatives) could be essential.",0

For comparisons between-groups, the standard mean difference and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were computed as the effect sizes. For diagnostic studies, a summary of sensitivity, specificity, positive likelihood ratios, negative likelihood ratios, and diagnostic odds ratio, which indicated the accuracy of KL-6 in the differentiation of ILDs and no ILDs, were calculated from the true positive, true negative, false positive, and false negative of each study. In addition, the summary receive-operating characteristics curve was constructed to summarize the TP and FP rates. For follow-up study, we computed hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% CIs for mortality. ILD patients showed elevated concentrations of KL-6, compared to healthy controls and patients without ILD.The meta-analysis showed a sensitivity (0.85 [95% CI: 0.77-0.91]) and specificity (0.97 [95% CI: 0.90-0.99]) of KL-6 for ILDs. In addition, it showed elevated baseline circulating levels of KL-6 in subsequent active ILD, compared to subsequent inactive ILD. Moreover, there was a significant association between baseline levels of circulating KL-6 and mortality of ILD (HR 2.95, 95% CI 2.45-3.55, I = 65.9%, P = .032).In conclusion, the study suggested that circulating KL-6 showed diagnostic and prognostic predictive values for ILDs.",0

Treatment is challenging. Antihistamines, the first-line and only approved treatment, are often not effective. Objective To systematically review the treatment options for DPU. Method A literature search of electronic databases for all relevant articles published till April 29, 2019, was conducted using the search terms delayed urticaria and pressure urticaria. This systematic review was conducted in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses recommendations. Results Twenty-one studies (8 randomized controlled trials [RCTs], 10 retrospective cohort studies, and 3 open-label prospective studies) were included. Second-generation H1 antihistamines (sgAHs) were effective in 3 RCTs. The combination of an sgAH and montelukast (2 RCTs) or an sgAH and theophylline (1 non-RCT) was more effective than the sgAH alone. The disease improved with omalizumab (4 non-RCTs), sulphones (3 non-RCTs), oral prednisolone (1 RCT and 2 non-RCTs), intravenous immunoglobulin (1 non-RCT), and gluten-free diet (1 non-RCT). There are no studies on updosing of antihistamines over standard dosage in DPU. Conclusions Overall, the quality of studies on DPU is low. Because of the lack of other evidence, antihistamines remain the first-line therapy. Updosing of sgAHs could be considered in patients with uncontrolled symptoms on the basis of the extrapolation of evidence from chronic spontaneous urticaria, even though there is no evidence of its efficacy over standard dosage. Addition of montelukast may be considered. Omalizumab or sulphones may be used in treatment-resistant patients. High-quality DPU studies should be conducted.",0

This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to examine whether frailty is a predictor of all-cause mortality and hospital readmission in older patients with ACS. A systematic search was carried out in PubMed, EMBASE and Web of Science databases for studies evaluating the association between frailty and outcomes in older patients with ACS. A meta-analysis was performed to determine the pooled effect estimate for the association between frailty and mortality and hospital readmission, respectively. A total of 1459 articles were retrieved based on our search strategy. Fifteen studies involving 10,245 patients were included in the meta-analysis. The pooled prevalence of frailty was 32% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 25–39%), and the pooled prevalence of pre-frailty was 33% (95% CI: 26–40%) in elderly patients with ACS. Pooled analyses showed that frailty was associated with significantly higher risk of all-cause mortality and readmission (hazard ratios [HRs] = 2.43 and 2.32, respectively). Pre-frailty was also associated with significantly higher risk of all-cause mortality and readmission, respectively (HRs = 1.55 and 1.34, respectively). Both frailty and pre-frailty are risk factors for all-cause mortality and readmission in older patients with ACS. Therefore, frailty assessment should be given sufficient attention in the management of older patients with ACS to help improve survival and reduce readmission rate.",0
https://doi.org/10.1007/s10147-020-01690-1,Prognostic value of preoperative hematologic biomarkers in urothelial carcinoma of the bladder treated with radical cystectomy: a systematic review and meta-analysis,"Abstract This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to assess the prognostic value of preoperative hematologic biomarkers in patients with urothelial carcinoma of the bladder treated with radical cystectomy. PUBMED, Web of Science, Cochrane Library, and Scopus databases were searched in September 2019 according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-analysis statement. Studies were deemed eligible if they compared cancer-specific survival in patients with urothelial carcinoma of the bladder with and without pretreatment laboratoryabnormalities. Formal meta-analyses were performed for this outcome. The systematic review identified 36 studies with 23,632 patients, of these, 32 studies with 22,224 patients were eligible for the meta-analysis. Several preoperative hematologic biomarkers were significantly associated with cancer-specific survival as follows: neutrophil − lymphocyte ratio (pooled hazard ratio [HR]: 1.20, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.11–1.29), hemoglobin (pooled HR: 0.87, 95% CI 0.82–0.94), C-reactive protein (pooled HR: 1.44, 95% CI 1.26–1.66), De Ritis ratio (pooled HR: 2.18, 95% CI 1.37–3.48), white blood cell count (pooled HR: 1.05, 95% CI 1.02–1.07), and albumin-globulin ratio (pooled HR: 0.26, 95% CI 0.14–0.48). Several pretreatment laboratory abnormalities in patients with urothelial carcinoma of the bladder were associated with cancer-specific mortality. Therefore, it might be useful to incorporate such hematologic biomarkers into prognostic tools for urothelial carcinoma of the bladder. However, given the study limitations including heterogeneity and retrospective nature of the primary data, the conclusions should be interpreted with caution.",0
https://doi.org/10.1007/s00420-020-01535-4,Interventions for common mental disorders in the occupational health service: a systematic review with a narrative synthesis,"Common mental disorders (CMD) are leading causes of decreased workability in Sweden and worldwide. Effective interventions to prevent or treat such disorders are important for public health.To synthesize the research literature regarding occupational health service (OHS) interventions targeting prevention or reduction of CMD among employees. The effect on workability (sickness absence, return-to-work and self-reported workability) and on CMD symptoms was evaluated in a narrative analysis.The literature search was performed in four electronic databases in two searches, in 2014 and in 2017.Population: studies investigating employees at risk or diagnosed with CMD, as well as preventive workplace intervention targeting mental health.studies where the recruitment or the intervention was delivered by the OHS or OHS personnel were included.individuals or groups who did not receive the target intervention.all types of outcomes concerning sickness absence and psychological health were included. Study quality was assessed using a Swedish AMSTAR-based checklist, and results from studies with low or medium risk of bias were narratively synthesized based on effect or absence thereof.Thirty-three studies were included and assessed for risk of bias. Twenty-one studies had low or medium risk of bias. In 18 studies, rehabilitation interventions were evaluated, 11 studies concerned interventions targeting employees at risk for developing CMD and four studies investigated preventive interventions. Work-focused cognitive behavioral therapy and problem-solving skill interventions decreased time to first return-to-work among employees on sick leave for CMD in comparison with treatment-as-usual. However, effect on return to full-time work was not consistent, and these interventions did not consistently improve CMD symptoms. Selective interventions targeting employees at risk of CMD and preventive interventions for employees were heterogeneous, so replication of these studies is necessary to evaluate effect.Other workplace interventions outside the OHS may have been missed by our search. There was considerable heterogeneity in the included studies, and most studies were investigating measures targeting the individual worker. Interventions at the workplace/organizational level were less common.Return-to-work and improvement of CMD symptoms are poorly correlated and should be addressed simultaneously in future interventions. Further, interventions for CMD administered through the occupational health service require further study. Rehabilitative and preventive strategies should be evaluated with scientifically robust methods, to examine the effectiveness of such interventions.",0
https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ypmed.2020.106067,Effectiveness of universal multiple-risk lifestyle interventions in reducing depressive symptoms: Systematic review and meta-analysis,"Abstract Though many studies have explored the association between single-risk lifestyle interventions and depression, unhealthy lifestyle factors often co-occur, with adults engaging in two or more risk behaviours. To date, little is known about the effectiveness of universal multiple-risk lifestyle interventions to reduce depressive symptoms. We conducted a SR/MA to assess the effectiveness of universal multiple-risk lifestyle interventions (by promoting a healthy diet, physical activity and/or smoking cessation) to reduce depressive symptoms in adults. We searched MEDLINE, Scopus, CENTRAL, PsycINFO, WOS, OpenGrey, the ICTRP and other sources from inception to 16 September 2019. We selected only randomized controlled trials, with no restrictions on language or setting. Our outcome was the reduction of depressive symptoms. We calculated the standardized mean difference using random-effect models. Sensitivity, sub-group and meta-regression analyses were performed. Of the 9386 abstracts reviewed, 311 were selected for full-text review. Of these, 23 RCTs met the inclusion criteria, including 7558 patients from four continents. Twenty RCTs provided valid data for inclusion in the meta-analysis. The pooled SMD was −0.184 (95% CI, −0.311 to −0.057; p = 0.005). We found no publication bias, but heterogeneity was substantial (I2 = 72%; 95% CI: 56% to 82%). The effectiveness disappeared when only studies with a low risk of bias were included. The quality of evidence according GRADE was low. Although a small preventive effect was found, the substantial heterogeneity and RCTs with lower risk of bias suggested no effectiveness of universal multiple-risk lifestyle interventions in reducing depressive symptoms in a varied adult population. Further evidence is required.",0
https://doi.org/10.1007/s11739-020-02355-7,Systematic review of the prevalence of current smoking among hospitalized COVID-19 patients in China: could nicotine be a therapeutic option?,"The effects of smoking on Corona Virus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) are currently unknown. The purpose of this study was to systematically examine the prevalence of current smoking among hospitalized patients with COVID-19 in China, considering the high-population smoking prevalence in China (26.6%). A systematic review of the literature (PubMed) was performed on April 1. Thirteen studies examining the clinical characteristics of hospitalized COVID-19 patients in China and presenting data on the smoking status were found. The pooled prevalence of current smoking from all studies was calculated by random-effect meta-analysis. To address the possibility that some smokers had quit shortly before hospitalization and were classified as former smokers on admission to the hospital, we performed a secondary analysis in which all former smokers were classified as current smokers. A total of 5960 patients were included in the studies identified. The current smoking prevalence ranged from 1.4% (95% CI 0.0-3.4%) to 12.6% (95% CI 10.6-14.6%). An unusually low prevalence of current smoking was observed from the pooled analysis (6.5%, 95% CI 4.9-8.2%) as compared to population smoking prevalence in China. The secondary analysis, classifying former smokers as current smokers, found a pooled estimate of 7.3% (95% CI 5.7-8.9%). In conclusion, an unexpectedly low prevalence of current smoking was observed among patients with COVID-19 in China, which was approximately 1/4th the population smoking prevalence. Although the generalized advice to quit smoking as a measure to reduce health risk remains valid, the findings, together with the well-established immunomodulatory effects of nicotine, suggest that pharmaceutical nicotine should be considered as a potential treatment option in COVID-19.",0
https://doi.org/10.1007/s10140-019-01732-w,The influence of arm positions on abdominal image quality of whole-body computed tomography in trauma: systematic review,"Abstract Purpose Whole-body computed tomography (WBCT) is the standard diagnostic method for evaluating polytrauma patients. When patients are unable to elevate their arms, the arms are placed along the body, which affects the image quality negatively. Aim of this systematic review is to evaluate the influence of below the shoulder arm positions on image quality of WBCT. Methods Literature in PubMed and Scopus databases was systematically searched. Results of the papers were stratified into 4 categories: arms elevated, 1 arm up 1 arm down, arms ventrally supported, arms along the body. A qualitative analysis was performed on subjective image quality and a quantitative analysis on objective quality (image noise). Results Eight studies were included with 1421 participants. Various studies reported significantly higher quality scores with arms elevated, compared to arms along the body. Significant differences in objective image quality were found between the arms elevated and the arms ventrally on support group. The arms ventrally supported group had a significantly higher image quality than the arms along the body group. A statistically significant difference was found in objective image quality between the 1 arm up 1 arm down and arms along the body group. No preferential below the shoulders position could be identified. Conclusion Positioning the arms alongside the body results in a poor image quality. Placing the arms on a pillow ventrally to the chest improves image quality. Interestingly, asymmetrical arm positioning has potential to improve the image quality for patients that are unable to elevate the arms.",0
https://doi.org/10.1080/15563650.2020.1752918,Treatment for beta-blocker poisoning: a systematic review,"Introduction: Beta-adrenoreceptor antagonist (beta-blocker) poisoning is a common overdose which can lead to significant morbidity and mortality.Objective: To evaluate the effects of treatments for beta-adrenoreceptor antagonist poisoning.Methods: Searches were conducted across MEDLINE (1946-26 November 2019, Ovid); Embase (1974-26 November 2019, Ovid); and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL, to 26 November 2019) utilising a combination of subject headings and free text. The search strategy identified 15, 553 citations. Two reviewers screened titles and abstracts prior to selecting 141 articles (Kappa on articles included = 0.982, 95% CI 0.980-0.985). Primary outcomes included mortality and improvement in haemodynamic parameters (e.g., heart rate, blood pressure or a composite measure able to quantitate a haemodynamic response).Results: The risk of bias was high for all interventions.Gastric decontamination: Fifteen case reports described the administration of activated charcoal and five detailed the use of gastric lavage. As there was concurrent utilisation of multiple interventions, it was difficult to draw definitive conclusions regarding the relative contribution of these interventions to mortality or survival.Catecholamines, inotropes and vasopressors: The use of catecholamines in treating beta-blocker toxicity was reported in 16 case reports, 3 case series and 2 animal studies. These agents most likely provided a survival benefit and improved haemodynamics.Atropine: Multiple intravenous boluses of atropine were associated with improvement in heart rate and blood pressure in one case report.Calcium: Intravenous calcium was associated with an improvement in haemodynamics in three out of six case reports but in association with multiple other therapies as well as in two animal studies.High-dose insulin euglycaemic therapy: The use of this therapy was associated with mortality benefit in 10 case series. Two case reports showed clear haemodynamic improvement in a timeframe consistent with insulin administration (bolus then continuous infusion). Maintenance dosing ranged from 1 to 10 units/kg/h of insulin. However, it is unclear whether high-dose insulin euglycaemic therapy improved haemodynamic response above catecholamines and other inotropic agents in humans. Hypoglycaemia and hypokalemia were commonly observed adverse effects.Glucagon: Glucagon was associated with minor improvements in haemodynamics through an increase in heart rate in two cases series, nine case reports and five animal studies.Methylthioninium chloride (methylene blue): Four case reports reported an association with improvement in haemodynamics following administration of methylene blue but in the setting of co-ingestion with amlodipine.Intravenous lipid emulsion therapy: There was variable response to intravenous lipid emulsion therapy reported in 10 case series, 5 animal studies and 21 case reports.Lignocaine: There were four case reports showing variable response to lignocaine in arrhythmias secondary to beta-blocker toxicity.Other treatments: Fructose diphosphate, levosimendan and amrinone did not provide a mortality or significant haemodynamic benefit in three animal studies and nine case reports. .Veno-arterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation: Veno-arterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation was associated with improved survival in patients with severe cardiogenic shock or cardiac arrest in an observational study and four cases series.Dialysis: The evidence of four case reports suggest haemodialysis may assist in the management of massive overdose of specific water-soluble beta-blockers (e.g., atenolol) by improving elimination; however, a survival or haemodynamic benefit was not established.Pacing: One case series and a single case report showed the utility of temporary overdrive cardiac pacing to prevent arrhythmias in sotalol toxicity.Conclusions: Catecholamines, vasopressors, high-dose insulin euglycaemic therapy and veno-arterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation were associated with reduced mortality. However, it must be acknowledged that multiple treatments were often given simultaneously. Haemodynamic improvements in blood pressure and cardiac output were seen with the use of catecholamines, vasopressin and high-dose insulin euglycaemic therapy. Evidence for treatment recommendations is almost entirely drawn from very low- to low-quality studies and subject to bias. However, it is reasonable to have a graduated response to cardiovascular instability beginning with intravenous fluids, commencement of a single or a combination of catecholamine inotropes and vasopressors depending upon the type of haemodynamic compromise (bradycardia, left ventricular dysfunction, vasodilation). High-dose insulin euglycaemic therapy can be introduced as an adjunctive inotrope and lastly, more invasive methods such as veno-arterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation should be considered in cases unresponsive to other therapies.",0

https://doi.org/10.1186/s12966-020-00957-0,The effectiveness and complexity of interventions targeting sedentary behaviour across the lifespan: a systematic review and meta-analysis,"Abstract Background Evidence suggests that sedentary behaviour (SB) is associated with poor health outcomes. SB at any age may have significant consequences for health and well-being and interventions targeting SB are accumulating. Therefore, the need to review the effects of multicomponent, complex interventions that incorporate effective strategies to reduce SB are essential. Methods A systematic review and meta-analysis were conducted investigating the impact of interventions targeting SB across the lifespan. Six databases were searched and two review authors independently screened studies for eligibility, completed data extraction and assessed the risk of bias and complexity of each of the included studies. Results A total of 77 adult studies ( n =62, RCTs) and 84 studies ( n =62, RCTs) in children were included. The findings demonstrated that interventions in adults when compared to active controls resulted in non-significant reductions in SB, although when compared to inactive controls significant reductions were found in both the short (MD -56.86; 95%CI -74.10, -39.63; n=4632; I 2 83%) and medium-to-long term (MD -20.14; 95%CI -34.13, -6.16; n=4537; I 2 65%). The findings demonstrated that interventions in children when compared to active controls may lead to relevant reductions in daily sedentary time in the short-term (MD -59.90; 95%CI -102.16, -17.65; n=267; I 2 86%), while interventions in children when compared to inactive controls may lead to relevant reductions in the short-term (MD -25.86; 95%CI -40.77, -10.96; n=9480; I 2 98%) and medium-to-long term (MD -14.02; 95%CI -19.49, -8.55; n=41,138; I 2 98%). The assessment of complexity suggested that interventions may need to be suitably complex to address the challenges of a complex behaviour such as SB, but demonstrated that a higher complexity score is not necessarily associated with better outcomes in terms of sustained long-term changes. Conclusions Interventions targeting reductions in SB have been shown to be successful, especially environmental interventions in both children and adults. More needs to be known about how best to optimise intervention effects. Future intervention studies should apply more rigorous methods to improve research quality, considering larger sample sizes, randomised controlled designs and valid and reliable measures of SB.",0

This study provides a comprehensive review of the published research on the association between early life adversity and markers of inflammation in children and adolescents. We conducted a systematic review of the published literature on the association between early life adversity and markers of inflammation in pediatric populations. To date, 27 studies have been published in this area representing a wide range of global populations and diverse methods of which nearly half were prospective, longitudinal studies. Of these 27, only 12 studies shared an inflammatory outcome with 4 or more other studies; 9 for CRP, and 6 for IL-6. The association between early life adversity and both CRP, z = .07 [.04, .10], and IL-6, z = .17 [−.07, .42], were small and only significant for CRP although comparable in magnitude to the effects observed in adult samples. Descriptively, the association between early life adversity and CRP appeared to be stronger in studies conducted in infants and adolescents compared with middle childhood. There was minimal evidence of publication bias for studies measuring CRP, but evidence of publication bias for studies using IL-6. Eight studies have looked at the association between early life adversity and stimulated inflammatory cytokines in vitro, and both the methods and results of these studies were mixed; the majority observed exaggerated production of inflammatory cytokines despite mixed methodological approaches that make comparisons across studies difficult. In summary, the evidence supporting an association between early life adversity and inflammation in pediatric samples is limited so far by the number of studies and their heterogeneous methodological approaches. More research that is grounded in a developmental framework and informed by the complexity of the innate immune system is needed in this area.",0

However, the global epidemiology of HEV infection has not been comprehensively assessed. This study aims to map the global prevalence and identify the risk factors of HEV infection by performing a systematic review and meta-analysis. Methods: A systematic searching of articles published in Medline, Embase, Web of science, Cochrane and Google scholar databases till July 2019 was conducted to identify studies with HEV prevalence data. Pooled prevalence among different countries and continents was estimated. HEV IgG seroprevalence of subgroups was compared and risk factors for HEV infection were evaluated using odd ratios (OR). Results: We identified 419 related studies which comprised of 1 519 872 individuals. A total of 1 099 717 participants pooled from 287 studies of general population estimated a global anti-HEV IgG seroprevalence of 12.47% (95% CI 10.42-14.67; I2 = 100%). Notably, the use of ELISA kits from different manufacturers has a substantial impact on the global estimation of anti-HEV IgG seroprevalence. The pooled estimate of anti-HEV IgM seroprevalence based on 98 studies is 1.47% (95% CI 1.14-1.85; I2 = 99%). The overall estimate of HEV viral RNA-positive rate in general population is 0.20% (95% CI 0.15-0.25; I2 = 98%). Consumption of raw meat (P =.0001), exposure to soil (P <.0001), blood transfusion (P =.0138), travelling to endemic areas (P =.0244), contacting with dogs (P =.0416), living in rural areas (P =.0349) and receiving education less than elementary school (P <.0001) were identified as risk factors for anti-HEV IgG positivity. Conclusions: Globally, approximately 939 million corresponding to 1 in 8 individuals have ever experienced HEV infection. 15-110 million individuals have recent or ongoing HEV infection. Our study highlights the substantial burden of HEV infection and calls for increasing routine screening and preventive measures.",0

We included 39 articles for meta-analysis. The results showed that low-dose exposure to arsenic (≤ 10 μmol/L) could promote the expression of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) and phosphorylation-protein kinase B (p-AKT). High-dose arsenic exposure (> 10 μmol/L) promoted the expression of PI3K, HIF-1α, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), and p38MAPK (P38). Acute arsenic exposure (< 24 h) promoted the expression of PI3K, HIF-1α, and VEGF. Chronic arsenic exposure (≥ 24 h) promoted the expression of PI3K, p-AKT, and P38. Moreover, for normal tissue-derived cells, arsenic could induce the increased expression of PI3K, p-AKT, HIF-1α, and VEGF. For tumor tissue-derived cells, arsenic could induce the expression of PI3K, p-AKT, and P38. We found that arsenic exposure could activate the PI3K/AKT pathway, further induce the high expression of HIF-1α, and then upregulate the levels of miRNA-21 and VEGF, promote the expression of proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA), and ultimately lead to malignant cell proliferation. Our findings indicated that arsenic could increase the expression of HIF-1α by activating the PI3K/AKT pathway and eventually induce malignant cell proliferation.",0

In advanced kidney cancer, checkpoint inhibitors have shown improved outcomes in first- and second-line settings compared to standard of care, but the role of patient sex on treatment outcome is unclear. We aimed to assess the efficacy of immunotherapy according to patient sex in advanced kidney cancer. Methods We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis according to PRISMA guidelines. A literature search was performed using Pubmed, Scopus®, Web of Science™ and The Cochrane Library to identify eligible studies published until February 16, 2019. Studies were included if they reported on the differential outcomes of male and female patients with metastatic kidney cancer receiving immunotherapy. Our outcomes of interest were overall survival or progression-free survival. Results Four randomized controlled trials comprising a total of 3664 patients (2715 males and 949 females) met our inclusion criteria. Both men and women with metastatic kidney cancer had an OS- and PFS advantage with immunotherapy compared to standard-of-care, but no statistically significant difference between the sexes was observed (OS HR for men 0.69, 0.59-0.8, p = 0.40; HR for women 0.62, 0.48-0.81, p = 0.13; PFS HR for men 0.7, 0.59-0.82, p = 0.24; HR for women 0.68, 0.52-0.90, p = 0.105). Conclusion In advanced kidney cancer patients receiving checkpoint inhibitors, there seems to be no association of patient sex with treatment outcome.",0
https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jse.2020.01.080,Does humeral torsion play a role in shoulder and elbow injury profiles of overhead athletes: a systematic review,"Background Humeral retrotorsion (HRT) is one bony adaptation that occurs in overhead athletes. This bony adaptation often leads to bilateral changes in range of motion at the glenohumeral joint. Because HRT can create different stress environments on the surrounding tissue, it may play a role in upper-limb injury and pain profiles. Therefore, the aim of this review was to examine whether HRT plays a role in shoulder and elbow injury profiles. Methods Two separate critical appraisal tools were administered: the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale (case control) and the Appraisal Tool for Cross-sectional Studies. The primary author extracted all data and obtained means and standard deviations for each outcome. Cohen d effect sizes (ESs) were calculated (ES [95% confidence interval]) for all HRT measurements including nondominant, dominant, and side-to-side differences. Finally, the Strength of Recommendation Taxonomy was used to evaluate the overall strength of the recommendation. Results Nine articles were included in this review. Large ESs were present in 2 studies on examination of symptomatic and asymptomatic dominant HRT and ranged between 0.83 (0.08-1.55) and –2.57 (–3.66 to 1.99). The majority of all ESs for all HRT measurements were moderate or low, rendering comparisons between asymptomatic and symptomatic cohorts that were not clinically meaningful. Conclusion The Strength of Recommendation Taxonomy rating was C based on inconsistent findings. Differences in sports populations and definitions of injuries across studies may be one reason for the varying ESs. HRT does occur in the overhead population, but the degree to which this HRT starts to affect upper-limb injury is unknown and is more than likely player specific and multifactorial.",0

Aim: In the present study, the evidence about the association between vitamin D deficiency and Behcet’s disease activity was systematically reviewed and meta-analyzed. Method: We searched the English and Persian databases of Medline (Ovid), CINHAL, Scopus, Proquest, the Cochrane library and SID, IranDoc, Magiran, Iran Medex for articles published up until May 2018 with the keywords were related to serum vitamin D and active and inactive Behcet’s disease in adults. Meta-analysis was done using the CMA software. Results: A total of 138 titles were retrieved and reduced to 80 titles after deletion of duplicates and finally after close assessing of titles and abstracts eight eligible studies including a total of 939 participants were identified for systematic review and meta-analysis. According to the results of the meta-analysis, the pooled effect size of the differences in the serum level of vitamin D in patients with inactive Behçet’s Disease and healthy controls was [OR:−0.05; 95% CI:−2.05, 1.94; p = 0.95]. The serum vitamin D level was significantly lower in active patients compared with healthy controls [OR:1.21; 95%CI: −0.12, 2.31; p = 0.03]. The pooled effect size of the differences in the serum level of vitamin D in active and inactive Behçet’s Disease was [OR:−0.71; 95%CI: −1.41, −0.007; p = 0.04] Conclusion: There is an association between vitamin D deficiency and active Behçet’s Disease. Future studies investigating the association of vitamin D deficiency and Behçet’s Disease needs to involve following information: dietary intake of calcium and vitamin D, measuring of sun exposure, report of drug consumption and physical activity level.",0

Numerous studies have suggested that biogas slurry purification and biogas upgrading can occur simultaneously via microalgae-based technology. However, there is no comprehensive review on this technology with respect to the nutrient removal from biogas slurry and biogas upgrading. This article summarizes microalgal cultivation with biogas slurry and biogas from anaerobic digestion. The parameters, techniques, and modes of microalgae cultivation have been discussed in detail to achieve high efficiency in biogas slurry purification and biogas upgrading. In addition, the evaluation of energy efficiency and safety has also been explored. Compared with mono-cultivation of microalgae and co-cultivation of microalgae and bacteria, microalgae-fungi symbiosis has demonstrated greater development prospect and higher energy efficiency and the energy consumption for pollutants and CO2 removal were 14.2-39.0% · USD-1 and 19.9-23.3% · USD-1, respectively. Further, a sustainable recycling scheme is proposed for the purification of biogas slurry from anaerobic digestion process and biogas upgrading via microalgae-based technology.",0

To examine the efficacy of strategies used in occupational therapy to improve play in ASD, authors completed a systematic review of papers from January 1980 through January 2019. Search terms included autism, Asperger’s, ASD, autistic in combination with play, playfulness, pretend, imagination, praxis, creativity, and generativity. Twenty papers met inclusion criteria and were reviewed. Reviewed interventions included parent education, modified play materials or environments, imitation of the child, and modeling by an adult, a peer, or video. Moderate to strong support exists for the specific strategies of imitation of the child and modeling for the child, with lesser or mixed support for other strategies. Certain strategies commonly used in occupational therapy may be effective in improving the occupation of play in ASD.",0

This systematic review aims to assess relationships between lower limb peripheral venous diseases (lower limb varicose veins (LLVV), venous thromboembolism (VTE) comprising deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism), peripheral arterial disease (intermittent claudication, aortic dissection, aortic aneurysm) and occupational constraints among working adults. Methods Several databases were systematically searched until February 2019 for observational studies and clinical trials. Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses method was used for article selection. Quality assessment and risk of bias were evaluated using Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology and Newcastle-Ottawa scales. Results Among the 720 screened articles, 37 remained after full-text evaluation. Among the 21 studies on LLVV, prolonged standing was significantly associated to a higher risk of varicose veins with a threshold probably around &gt;3 to 4 hours/day but exposure duration in years was not sufficiently considered. Seated immobility was often observed in workers, with no sufficient evidence to prove that prolonged sitting at work is related to VTE. Carrying heavy loads, stress at work and exposure to high temperatures have emerged more recently notably in relation to varicose veins but need to be better explored. Only three studies discussed the potential role of work on peripheral arterial disease development. Conclusions Although some observational studies showed that prolonged standing can be related to varicose veins and that seated immobility at work could be linked to VTE, very little is known about peripheral arterial disease and occupational constraints. Clinical trials to determine preventive strategies at work are needed. PROSPERO registration number CRD42019127652.",0

To explore sex differences related to the experience of specific symptoms (2). To investigate the early time course of symptoms (3). A meta-analysis was performed from 28 studies assessing mood and anxiety symptoms during the earliest phases of tobacco abstinence (up to 24 hrs post-quit) conducted from 1999 to 2019. Results revealed a significant (p < 0.0001) increase in ‘anxiety’, ‘anger/irritability’, ‘depressed mood /sadness’, and composite negative affect (‘NA’) in the 24 hours following smoking cessation. The largest effect size was detected for ‘anxiety’ (0.63). A qualitative analysis was performed to investigate sex differences and the time course of the specific symptoms. Results indicated that female smokers may experience worse mood symptoms compared to male smokers and that these symptoms may emerge within 3 hrs post-quit. Smoking cessation programs should implement sex-tailored interventions in order to improve their effectiveness, while future research should focus on alternative methods of nicotine administration.",0

Recent studies have shown extensive ac4C modifications in human and yeast mRNAs. ac4C helps to correctly read codons during translation and improves translation efficiency and the stability of mRNA. At present, the research of ac4C involves a variety of detection methods. The formation of ac4C is closely related to N-acetyltransferase 10 (NAT10) and its helpers, such as putative tRNA acetyltransferase (TAN1) for tRNA ac4C and small nucleolar RNA (snoRNA) for rRNA ac4C. Also, ac4C is associated with the development, progression, and prognosis of a variety of human diseases. Here, we summarize the history of ac4C research and the detection technologies of ac4C. We then summarized the role and mechanism of ac4C in gene-expression regulation and demonstrated the relevance of ac4C to a variety of human diseases, especially cancer. Finally, we list the future challenges of the ac4C research and demonstrate a research strategy for the interactions among several abundant modified nucleosides on mRNA.",0

The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of periodontal bacteria infection on incidence and prognosis of cancer.A systematic literature search of PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, and Cochrane Library databases was performed to obtain 39 studies comprising 7184 participants. The incidence of cancer was evaluated as odd ratios (OR) with a 95% confidence interval (95% CI) using Review Manager 5.2 software. Overall survival, cancer-specific survival and disease-free survival, which were measured as hazard ratios (HR) with a 95% CI using Review Manager 5.2 software.Our results indicated that periodontal bacteria infection increased the incidence of cancer (OR = 1.25; 95%CI: 1.03-1.52) and was associated with poor overall survival (HR = 1.75; 95% CI: 1.40-2.20), disease-free survival (HR = 2.18; 95%CI: 1.24-3.84) and cancer-specific survival (HR = 1.85, 95%CI: 1.44-2.39).

Design Systematic review and meta-analysis of prospective studies. Data sources Electronic databases, including PubMed, Embase, and Google Scholar. Study selection Prospective cohort studies were included if they reported adjusted relative risks, odds ratios, or hazard ratios and 95% confidence intervals for all cause mortality or cardiovascular outcomes in participants with unrecognised myocardial infarction compared with those without myocardial infarction. Data extraction and synthesis The primary outcomes were composite major adverse cardiac events, all cause mortality, and cardiovascular mortality associated with UMI-ECG and UMI-CMR. The secondary outcomes were the risks of recurrent coronary heart disease or myocardial infarction, stroke, heart failure, and atrial fibrillation. Pooled hazard ratios and 95% confidence intervals were reported. The heterogeneity of outcomes was compared in clinically recognised and unrecognised myocardial infarction. Results The meta-analysis included 30 studies with 253 425 participants and 1 621 920 person years of follow-up. UMI-ECG was associated with increased risks of all cause mortality (hazard ratio 1.50, 95% confidence interval 1.30 to 1.73), cardiovascular mortality (2.33, 1.66 to 3.27), and major adverse cardiac events (1.61, 1.38 to 1.89) compared with the absence of myocardial infarction. UMI-CMR was also associated with increased risks of all cause mortality (3.21, 1.43 to 7.23), cardiovascular mortality (10.79, 4.09 to 28.42), and major adverse cardiac events (3.23, 2.10 to 4.95). No major heterogeneity was observed for any primary outcomes between recognised myocardial infarction and UMI-ECG or UMI-CMR. The absolute risk differences were 7.50 (95% confidence interval 4.50 to 10.95) per 1000 person years for all cause mortality, 11.04 (5.48 to 18.84) for cardiovascular mortality, and 27.45 (17.1 to 40.05) for major adverse cardiac events in participants with UMI-ECG compared with those without myocardial infarction. The corresponding data for UMI-CMR were 32.49 (6.32 to 91.58), 37.2 (11.7 to 104.20), and 51.96 (25.63 to 92.04), respectively. Conclusions UMI-ECG or UMI-CMR is associated with an adverse long term prognosis similar to that of recognised myocardial infarction. Screening for unrecognised myocardial infarction could be useful for risk stratification among patients with a high risk of cardiovascular disease.",0

To characterize the long-term impacts of four distinct spatially correlated urban environmental exposures – traffic-related air pollution (TRAP), noise, natural spaces, and neighborhood walkability – by evaluating studies including measures of at least two such exposures in relationship to mortality, cardiovascular disease, chronic respiratory disease, allergy, type 2 diabetes, or reproductive outcomes. Following the Navigation Guide framework, the literature was searched for studies published since 2003 and meeting predefined inclusion criteria. Identified studies were scored individually for risk of bias and all studies related to an exposure-group set were appraised for overall quality and strength of evidence. A total of 51 individual studies (TRAP and noise: n = 29; TRAP and natural spaces: n = 10; noise and natural spaces: n = 2; TRAP, noise, and natural spaces: n = 7; TRAP, noise, natural spaces, and walkability: n = 3) were included. When TRAP and noise were considered jointly, evidence was sufficient for increased cardiovascular morbidity with higher noise exposures; sufficient for no effect of TRAP on CVD morbidity; sufficient for increased mortality with higher TRAP exposures, but limited for noise; and limited for increased adverse reproductive outcomes with higher TRAP exposures and no effect of noise. Looking at natural spaces and TRAP, there was limited evidence for lower risk of chronic respiratory disease and small increases in birthweight with greater natural space; this relationship with birthweight persisted after adjustment for noise as well. Evidence was inadequate for all other exposure groups and outcomes. Studies that properly account for the complexity of relationships between urban form and physical health are limited but suggest that even highly correlated exposures may have distinct effects.

This study aimed to determine whether gastroenteritis would increase the risk of SCZ onset.We performed a systematic literature search in PubMed, Cochrane Library and the Web of Science database up to 23 November 2019. The pooled relative risk (RR) with 95% confidence interval (CI) was used to estimate the effect of gastroenteritis on SCZ. Stratified analysis was conducted by study design, diagnostic criteria, region, adjustment for confounders, gastroenteritis sub-classification and data source.This meta-analysis included nine published articles with 13,830,871 subjects. Overall, there was no significant relationship between gastroenteritis and SCZ onset (N [number of studies] = 11, RR = 1.06, 95% CI: 0.81-1.39). However, pooled results from cohort studies suggested that gastroenteritis significantly increased the risk of SCZ (N = 7, RR = 1.27, 95% CI = 1.05-1.53). Increased risk of SCZ was observed in America (N = 3) and Australia (N = 2), whereas no association was found in Europe (N = 1) and Asia (N = 5). The pooled RR, adjusting for ≥2 confounders (N = 5), was higher than those adjusting for <2 confounders (N = 6). The effects also varied in diagnostic criteria, gastroenteritis sub-classification and data source.Based on current research evidence, it is not yet certain that gastroenteritis is a risk factor for SCZ, and more research on the association between specific gastroenteritis and SCZ is needed.",0

However, winter peaks and lack of seasonality have also been noted. Objectives To systematically collate and examine the evidence describing seasonal patterns in the incidence of Acinetobacter infection in hospitalized patients. Data sources MEDLINE/Ovid, EMBASE, Scopus and Web of Science. Study eligibility criteria Longitudinal observational studies investigating seasonal variation in the incidence of Acinetobacter infection. Participants Patients receiving hospital care. Interventions Routine hospital care. Methods Systematic review with narrative evidence synthesis structured around clinical and methodological heterogeneity and internal validity of retrieved studies, seasonal patterns and risk factors detected, and stated hypotheses of mechanisms underlying seasonality. To examine consistency in reported seasonal patterns across different conditions, monthly incidence data were extracted, standardised, weighted and presented graphically. Results Twenty-five studies reporting 37006 cases of Acinetobacter infection or colonization during 1954 months of follow-up were reviewed. Standardised monthly incidence data pooled across studies exhibited a global seasonal pattern with an incidence peak in summer/warmer months and a trough in winter/colder months. This seasonal pattern remained consistent under different weighting schemes accounting for study size, length of follow-up and overall quality assessment rating. Seasonality persisted in different clinical settings and for different types and sources of infection. Nine studies provided consistent evidence of temperature-associated variation in Acinetobacter incidence, while there were controversial findings regarding other environmental variables. No study detected patient-related or clinical practice-related seasonal variation in Acinetobacter incidence. Conclusions Despite substantial clinical and methodological heterogeneity in retrieved studies, a consistent global seasonal pattern in Acinetobacter infection incidence was evident in this review. This merits attention when designing or evaluating infection control interventions in hospitals. Future research should focus on elucidating driving mechanisms underlying the observed seasonality.",0

Neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) has also been attempted in resectable pancreatic cancer (RPC); however, its role remains controversial. This study aimed to compare the clinical difference between NAC and upfront resection (UR) in RPC.Electronic databases including PubMed, Embase, Medline, Web of Science, ClinicalTrials.gov, and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials were searched for relevant articles from inception to February 2019 that addressed the overall survival in patients with RPC treated with or without NAC to identify eligible studies. Eleven studies were included in the final meta-analysis. The quality assessment of the included studies was based on the Newcastle-Ottawa quality scale. Data of the unresectable rate, R0 resection rate, and positive lymph node rate were also extracted in each study for further analysis. Pooled hazard ratio (HR), odds ratio (OR), and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated to assess the strength of the association.A total of eleven studies (eight cohort studies and three randomized controlled trials) involving 9773 patients were included. Ten of the eleven studies followed the ""intention-to-treat"" principle. NAC was found to be significantly associated with a higher R0 resection rate (P < 0.0001; OR = 2.62, 95% CI 1.70-4.03) and increased negative lymph node rate (P < 0.00001; OR = 0.34, 95% CI 0.31-0.37). However, compared with the UR group, NAC was related to a lower surgical resection rate (P = 0.0004; OR = 2.18, 95% CI 1.41-3.37). Overall, the NAC group exhibited no benefits in terms of overall survival compared with that in the UR group (P = 0.10; HR = 0.86, 95% CI 0.73-1.03). In the subgroup analysis, however, patients who received gemcitabine-based regimen as the NAC strategy had more favorable overall survival than that in the UR group (P = 0.04; HR = 0.75, 95% CI 0.57-0.99).NAC may be associated with a lower resection rate; however, it is associated with an increased R0 resection rate and lymph node negative rate. Although overall survival was similar in patients with or without NAC, gemcitabine-based NAC might provide longer overall survival. Further large-volume, randomized controlled trials are needed to validate the improved prognosis of patients undergoing NAC.",0

For these children, eye gaze assistive technology can be used to facilitate communication. Eye gaze assistive technology outcomes for children and youth were analyzed in this systematic review. Database and hand-searches yielded 4412 unduplicated results, of which 11 articles were eligible for this review. Outcome measures, as well as environmental and personal factors, were mapped to the World Health Organization's International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health framework. Communication outcomes were most prevalent and co-occurred with outcomes in all reported activities and participation domains. Environmental and personal factors were classified as either facilitators or as barriers in relation to device uptake and success. Although comprehensive professional and caregiver support was the primary facilitator for success, barriers could lead to rejection of the technology even when children were successful using the system.",0

However, no reference range values are available for 8-isoprosante in exhaled breath condensate (EBC) of healthy adults, enabling its meaningful interpretation as a biomarker. We conducted this systematic review and meta-analysis according to the protocol following PROSPERO (CRD42020146623). After searching and analyzing the literature, we included 86 studies. After their qualitative synthesis and risk of bias assessment, 52 studies were included in meta-analysis. The latter focused on studies using immunological analytical methods and investigated how the concentrations of 8-isoprostane differ based on gender. We found that gender had no significant effect in 8-isoprostane concentration. Among other studied factors, such as individual characteristics and factors related to EBC collection, only the device used for EBC collection significantly affected measured 8-isoprostane concentrations. However, adjustment for the factors related to EBC collection, yielded uncertainty whether this effect is due to the device itself or to the other factors. Given this uncertainty, we estimated the reference range values of 8-isoprostane stratified by gender and EBC collection device. A better standardization of EBC collection seems necessary; as well more studies using chemical analytical methods to extend this investigation.",0

Purpose The purpose of this systematic review and meta-analysis of animal studies was to investigate whether material and surface properties of transmucosal implant components can influence the peri-implant soft-tissue adhesion at a histological level. Material and methods An electronic and hand search was conducted until August 2019. Histological animal studies comparing soft-tissue response to abutment or transmucosal collar with different materials and/or surface characteristics were selected by 2 independent reviewers. Risk of bias in individual studies was evaluated. Histomorphometric data on the dimension of the peri-implant attachment were recorded, and a quantitative synthesis by a meta-analysis was performed. Risk of bias in individual studies was evaluated in accordance with the Systematic Review Centre for Laboratory Animal Experimentation Risk of Bias tool. Results Eighteen relevant studies out of 1187 were identified, none with a low risk of bias for all domains. Data from only 4 studies could be meta-analyzed. Comparable results in terms of peri-implant attachment dimensions between test and control groups were found, except for a significantly higher apical junctional epithelium to coronal bone to implant (ajE-CBI) distance for chemically modified acid-etched compared with titanium machined surfaces. Non–meta-analyzable and/or qualitative results highlighted some improved properties also for microgrooved and oxidized surfaces. Conclusions Limited data from animal studies suggest that some characteristics of the transmucosal implant components may affect peri-implant soft-tissue adhesion and stabilization but do not allow definitive conclusions. Future research should improve study design to increase the availability of comparable and suitable data on this topic.",0
https://doi.org/10.1080/15563650.2019.1691221,Vilazodone poisoning: a systematic review,"Introduction: Vilazodone is a novel antidepressant approved for the treatment of major depressive disorder. It acts as a serotonin reuptake inhibitor and 5-HT1A partial agonist. It may lead to a more rapid rise in serotonin concentration in the synaptic cleft than selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), which could potentially cause more severe toxicity in overdose.Methods: We performed a systematic review of the medical literature to identify all available peer reviewed evidence regarding vilazodone poisoning.Results: We identified nine unique articles describing vilazodone poisoning. These included eleven unique case reports of vilazodone poisoning, three reviews of data from the National Poison Data System, and one review of data from the Toxicology Investigators Consortium. Children were frequently symptomatic, and many developed seizures and/or serotonin syndrome. Adults and adolescents also developed serotonin syndrome after single-substance ingestion of vilazodone. ICU admission, endotracheal intubation, and parenteral benodiazepines were frequently required.Discussion: Vilazodone, unlike SSRIs, may frequently cause serotonin syndrome in single-substance ingestions. Children ingesting as little as the minimum daily dose of vilazodone, 10 mg, suffered major clinical toxicity.Conclusion: Vilazodone poisoning may produce serious clinical effects, including serotonin syndrome and seizures. Young children are at particularly high risk and may become critically ill after ingestion of very small amounts of vilazodone. Admission of poisoned children to a monitored setting and prolonged clinical observation of poisoned adults may be reasonable.",0

There is evidence from original research that SSSG exposure provides performance and health benefits for untrained adults. The aim of this systematic review was to summarize recent evidence on the acute and long-term effects of SSSG on physical fitness, physiological responses, and health indices in healthy untrained individuals and clinical populations. This systematic literature search was conducted in four electronic databases (PubMed, Web of Science, SPORTDiscus) from inception until June 2019. The following key terms (and synonyms searched for by the MeSH database) were included and combined using the operators “AND”, “OR”, “NOT”: ((soccer OR football) AND (“soccer training” OR “football training” OR “soccer game*” OR “small-sided soccer game*”) AND (“physical fitness” OR “physiological adaptation*” OR “physiological response*” OR health OR “body weight” OR “body mass” OR “body fat” OR “bone composition” OR “blood pressure”)). The search syntax initially identified 1145 records. After screening for titles, abstracts, and full texts, 41 studies remained that examined the acute (7 studies) and long-term effects (34 studies) of SSSG-based training on physical fitness, physiological responses, and selected alth indices in healthy untrained individuals and clinical populations. No training-related injuries were reported in the 41 acute and long-term SSSG studies. Typically, a single session of SSSG lasted 12–20 min (e.g., 3 × 4 min with 3 min rest or 5 × 4 min with 4 min rest) involving 4–12 players (2 vs. 2 to 6 vs. 6) at an intensity ≥ 80% of HRmax. Following single SSSG session, high cardiovascular and metabolic demands were observed. Specifically, based on the outcomes, the seven acute studies reported average heart rates (HR) ≥ 80% of HRmax (165–175 bpm) and mean blood lactate concentrations exceeding 5 mmol/l (4.5–5.9 mmol/l) after single SSSG sessions. Based on the results of 34 studies (20 with healthy untrained, 10 with unhealthy individuals, and 4 with individuals with obesity), SSSG training lasted between 12 and 16 weeks and was performed 2–3 times per week. SSSG had positive long-term effects on physical fitness (e.g., Yo–Yo IR1 performance), physiological responses including maximal oxygen uptake (VO2max) [+ 7 to 16%], and many health-related markers such as blood pressure (reductions in systolic [− 7.5%] and diastolic [− 10.3%] blood pressure), body composition (decreased fat mass [− 2 to − 5%]), and improved indices of bone health (bone mineral density: [+ 5 to 13%]; bone mineral content: [+ 4 to 5%]), and metabolic (LDL-cholesterol [− 15%] as well as cardiac function (left-ventricular internal diastolic diameter [+ 8%], end diastolic volume [+ 21%], left-ventricular mass index [+ 18%], and left-ventricular ejection fraction [+ 8%]). Irrespective of age or sex, these health benefits were observed in both, untrained individuals and clinical populations. In conclusion, findings from this systematic review suggest that acute SSSG may elicit high cardiovascular and metabolic demands in untrained healthy adults and clinical populations. Moreover, this type of exercise is safe with positive long-term effects on physical fitness and health indices. Future studies are needed examining the long-term effects on physical fitness and physiological adaptations of different types of SSSG training (e.g., 3 vs. 3; 6 vs. 6) in comparison to continuous or interval training in different cohorts.",0
https://doi.org/10.7759/cureus.8207,Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) in Children: Vulnerable or Spared? A Systematic Review,"The ongoing pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has affected people from all cultures, religions, gender, and age groups around the world. In the last few months, several studies have been conducted on various aspects of COVID-19. Our goal was to see if the pediatric population is vulnerable to this infection. In this review, we conducted extensive research mainly by using the PubMed database. We used Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) and associated keywords to engage in an extensive search focussing on COVID-19 in the pediatric population. We discovered that most of the studies were from China, and some of them were in the Chinese language. However, English translations of many of the studies were available. For accessing the relevant statistical data, we relied on the World Health Organization (WHO) resources and the official website of the Ontario Government (ontario.ca). Most of the studies showed that the virus has affected the pediatric population. However, we found some differences among these studies regarding the severity of symptoms in children affected by COVID-19. While a few studies stated that the virus has presented with milder symptoms in the pediatric population, some studies have presented data of children who have suffered life-threatening complications due to COVID-19. Although the data is limited, we have been able to conclude from the studies we reviewed that COVID-19 does indeed affect children the same way as any other age group. Moreover, children can act as carriers of the virus and can endanger the lives of other individuals. Besides, neonates and infants can easily acquire the infection from family members without having any exposure to the outside world. Hence, utmost care should be taken while handling this population. More trials and studies should be conducted to analyze the impact of early diagnosis of infection in children and its management.",0
https://doi.org/10.1016/j.chest.2020.05.534,Sensitivity and Safety of Electromagnetic Navigation Bronchoscopy for Lung Cancer Diagnosis,"Background Bronchoscopy is a useful tool for the diagnosis of lesions near central airways; however, the diagnostic accuracy of these procedures for peripheral pulmonary lesions (PPLs) is a matter of ongoing debate. In this setting, electromagnetic navigation bronchoscopy (ENB) is a technique used to navigate and obtain samples from these lesions. This systematic review and meta-analysis aims to explore the sensitivity of ENB in patients with PPLs suspected of lung cancer. Research Question In patients with peripheral pulmonary lesion suspected of lung cancer, what is the sensitivity and safety of electromagnetic navigation bronchoscopy compared to surgery or longitudinal follow up? Study Design and Methods A comprehensive search of several databases was performed. Extracted data included sensitivity of ENB for malignancy, adequacy of the tissue sample, and complications. The study quality was assessed using the QUADAS-2 tool, and the combined data were meta-analyzed using a bivariate method model. A summary receiver operatic characteristic curve (sROC) was created. Finally, the quality of evidence was rated using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation approach. Results Forty studies with a total of 3,342 participants were included in our analysis. ENB reported a pooled sensitivity of 77% (95% CI, 72%-82%; I2 = 80.6%) and a specificity of 100% (95% CI, 99%-100%; I2 = 0%) for malignancy. The sROC showed an area under the curve of 0.955 (P = .03). ENB achieved a sufficient sample for ancillary tests in 90.9% (95% CI, 84.8%-96.9%; I2 = 80.7%). Risk of pneumothorax was 2.0% (95% CI, 1.0-3.0; I2 = 45.2%). We found subgroup differences according to the risk of bias and the number of sampling techniques. Meta-regression showed an association between sensitivity and the mean distance of the sensor tip to the center of the nodule, the number of tissue sampling techniques, and the cancer prevalence in the study. Interpretation ENB is very safe with good sensitivity for diagnosing malignancy in patients with PPLs. The applicability of our findings is limited because most studies were done with the superDimension navigation system and heterogeneity was high.

https://doi.org/10.1186/s12875-020-01107-y,Application of normalisation process theory in understanding implementation processes in primary care settings in the UK: a systematic review,"Abstract Background Normalisation Process Theory (NPT) provides a framework to understand how interventions are implemented, embedded, and integrated in healthcare settings. Previous reviews of published literature have examined the application of NPT across international healthcare and reports its benefits. However, given the distinctive clinical function, organisational arrangements and the increasing management of people with a wide variety of conditions in primary care settings in the United Kingdom, it is important to understand how and why authors utilise and reflect on NPT in such settings to inform and evaluate implementation processes. Methods A systematic review of peer-reviewed literature using NPT in primary care settings in the United Kingdom (UK) was conducted. Eight electronic databases were searched using replicable methods to identify articles published between January 2012 and April 2018. Data were analysed using a framework approach. Results Thirty-one articles met the inclusion criteria. Researchers utilised NPT to explore the implementation of interventions, targeting a wide range of health services and conditions, within primary care settings in the UK. NPT was mostly applied qualitatively; however, a small number of researchers have moved towards mixed and quantitative methods. Some variation was observed in the use of NPT constructs and sub-constructs, and whether and how researchers undertook modification to make them more relevant to the implementation process and multiple stakeholder perspectives. Conclusion NPT provides a flexible framework for the development and evaluation of complex healthcare interventions in UK primary care settings. This review updates the literature on NPT use and indicates that its application is well suited to these environments, particularly in supporting patients with long-term conditions and co-morbidities. We recommend future research explores the receipt of interventions by multiple stakeholders and suggest that authors reflect on justifications for using NPT in their reporting.",0
https://doi.org/10.18502/ijph.v49i4.3168,The Efficacy of Periodic Complete Blood Count Tests in Evaluation of the Health Status of Radiation Workers in Iran: A Systematic Review,"Background: Periodic medical examinations of radiation workers are routinely conducted in many countries. Although low dose radiation (LDR) is not expected to cause a significant effect on blood count, the periodic examination usually includes reviewing the work history, general medical history, a physical examination and collecting a blood sample. Despite lymphocytes are the most sensitive cells to radiation, their counts do not show any significant change as long as the radiation level is less than a few hundreds of millisievert (mSv). In spite of this, in Iran, radiation workers, even those who work in diagnostic radiology departments, are regularly examined for blood count changes. Methods: After a detailed search in PubMed, ISI, Scopus, SID and Google Scholar, only 12 out of 650 articles matched our criteria. A review of these 12 reports was conducted. The full texts were fully reviewed by the authors. Results: The complete blood count (CBC) test has a very low efficacy in evaluation of the adverse health effects of ionizing radiation in radiation workers. Therefore, finding alternative methods with a higher efficacy is recommended. Conclusion: CBC tests cannot be introduced as valid markers of potential radiation effects in most occupational exposures. Given this consideration, in periodic tests of radiation workers, cytogenetic tests can be the gold-standard method. In particular, due to its relatively low cost and good sensitivity and specificity, the dicentric assay can be promising. Moreover, the simple and rapid evaluation of micronuclei by fast automated scoring systems can be a good alternative for current low efficacy CBC tests.",0
https://doi.org/10.1111/obr.12981,Foetal and childhood exposure to famine and the risks of cardiometabolic conditions in adulthood: A systematic review and meta‐analysis of observational studies,"A systematic review and meta-analysis of observational studies was performed to provide a deeper understanding of the associations between foetal and childhood exposure to famine and the risks of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), metabolic syndrome, hypertension, hyperglycaemia, dyslipidaemia, obesity, overweight, coronary heart disease, stroke, and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) in adulthood. Both foetal and childhood exposure to famine were positively associated with the risks of T2DM (foetal exposure: RR 1.37, 95% CI, 1.23-1.52; childhood exposure: RR 1.33, 95% CI, 1.08-1.64), metabolic syndrome (RR 1.26, 95% CI, 1.07-1.50; RR 1.24, 95% CI, 1.13-1.35), hypertension (RR 1.30, 95% CI, 1.07-1.57; RR 1.33, 95% CI, 1.02-1.74), hyperglycaemia (RR 1.27, 95% CI, 1.11-1.45; RR 1.25, 95% CI, 1.10-1.42), dyslipidaemia (RR 1.48, 95% CI, 1.33-1.66; RR 1.27, 95% CI, 1.12-1.45), obesity (RR 1.19, 95% CI, 1.02-1.39; RR 1.13, 95% CI, 1.00-1.28), overweight (RR 1.17, 95% CI, 1.07-1.29; RR 1.07, 95% CI, 1.00-1.14), coronary heart disease (RR 1.22, 95% CI, 1.00-1.51; RR 1.21, 95% CI, 1.09-1.35), and moderate-to-severe NAFLD (RR 1.66, 95% CI, 1.07-2.57; RR 1.68, 95% CI, 1.41-1.99) in adulthood. No association was observed for the risks of stroke or mild NAFLD. Adjustments for age, alcohol, smoking, body mass index, and physical activity nullified some associations. The associations were generally stronger in women than in men. In summary, foetal and childhood exposure to famine may confer greater risks of developing certain cardiometabolic conditions in adulthood, particularly in women. The extent to which risks for cardiometabolic conditions are associated with early-life famine appears to be determined by certain factors in adulthood.",1

This review aimed to estimate associations between prenatal NO 2 exposure and neurodevelopment for children. Articles published until May 2019 reported prenatal NO 2 exposure and children’s cognition, psychomotor, language, attention, IQ, and behavior function were searched according to all related terms. The main databases we retrieved included PubMed, Web of Science, Embase, and Cochrane Library. Coefficient was extracted, conversed, and synthesized by random effects meta-analysis. Meanwhile, qualitatively describe would be used for some studies which cannot be synthesized quantitatively for lack of quantity or methods inconsistency. Finally, a total of 3848 citations were searched, and only 10 studies were included. We estimated that per 10 μg/m 3 increase of NO 2 during pregnancy was associated with a − 0.76 point decrease in global psychomotor (95% CI, − 1.34, − 0.18) and a − 0.62 point decrease in fine psychomotor for children (95% CI, − 1.09, − 0.16). But no significant association found in general cognitive and language. In addition, through the literature review, it seemed that prenatal exposure to NO 2 might cause adverse impacts on children’s attention, IQ, and different behaviors, but this requires confirmation from further researches. Our study indicated that prenatal exposure to NO 2 seems to be associated with impaired neural development for children, especially for fine psychomotor. However, further studies are needed for determining the effects of prenatal air pollution exposure on attention, IQ, and behavior.",1

Objective The purpose of this study was to describe the clinical course and outcomes of patients with both an S-ICD and an LVAD at our institution and via a systematic review of published studies. Methods We performed a retrospective cohort study of all patients who underwent LVAD implantation from 2009 to 2019 at Duke University Hospital. We also performed a systematic review of studies involving patients with an S-ICD and LVAD using the PubMed/Embase databases. Results Of 588 patients undergoing LVAD implantation with a preexisting implantable cardioverter-defibrillator, 4 had an S-ICD in situ after LVAD implantation. All 4 patients developed electromagnetic interference (EMI) in the primary/secondary vectors after LVAD implantation, resulting in inappropriate implantable cardioverter-defibrillator shocks in 2 patients. Sensing in the alternate vector was adequate immediately postoperatively in 1 patient. Postoperative undersensing was present in the alternate vector in 3 patients but improved at first outpatient follow-up in 2 patients, allowing tachy therapies to be reenabled. Eight studies involving 27 patients were identified in the systematic review. EMI was common and frequently absent in the alternate vector (6 of 7 patients). Conclusion Undersensing and EMI are common after LVAD implantation in patients with an S-ICD in situ, particularly in the primary and secondary sensing vectors. Undersensing in the alternate vector may improve during follow-up, obviating the need for device revision or extraction.",0

Controversy remains whether bicaval OHT is superior to biatrial OHT in both early and late outcomes. This study aimed to provide an overview of the early and late outcomes in patients who underwent a bicaval or biatrial OHT.A systematic literature search was performed for articles published before December 2017. Studies comparing adult patients undergoing biatrial OHT and bicaval OHT were included. Early outcomes were pooled in odds ratios and late outcomes were pooled in rate ratios. Late survival was visualized by a pooled Kaplan-Meier curve.A total of 36 publications were included in the meta-analysis, counting 3555 patients undergoing biatrial OHT and 3208 patients undergoing bicaval OHT. Early outcomes in mortality, tricuspid regurgitation, mitral regurgitation, and permanent pacemaker implantation differed significantly in favor of the bicaval OHT patients. Long-term survival was significantly better in patients undergoing bicaval vs biatrial OHT (hazard ratio, 1.32; 95% confidence interval, 1.1-1.6; P = .008). Also, late tricuspid regurgitation was less frequently seen in the bicaval OHT patients (rate ratio, 2.14; 95% CI, 1.17-3.94; P = .014).This systematic review with meta-analysis shows that bicaval OHT results in more favorable early and late outcomes for patients undergoing a bicaval OHT compared with a biatrial OHT. Therefore, bicaval OHT should be considered as preferable technique for OHT.",0

We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis to assess oncologic outcomes and perioperative morbidity following HIPEC among primary EOC patients. <h3>Methods</h3> We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, from inception to August 2019, for observational and randomized studies of primary EOC patients undergoing HIPEC. We assessed risk of bias using the Institute of Health Economics Quality Appraisal Checklist for single-arm cohort studies, Newcastle-Ottawa Scale for comparative cohort studies, and <i>Cochrane Collaboration's Tool</i> for randomized trials. We qualitatively summarized survival outcomes and calculated the pooled proportion of 30-day grade III-IV morbidity and postoperative death. Results: We identified 35 articles including 2252 primary EOC patients; one study was a randomized trial, and only six studies included a comparator group of surgery alone. The timing, temperature, and chemotherapeutic agents used for HIPEC differed across studies. Reported OS was highly variable (3-year OS range: 46–77%); three comparative cohort studies and the sole randomized trial reported statistically significant survival benefits for HIPEC over surgery alone, while two comparative cohort studies did not. The pooled proportions for grade III-IV morbidity and postoperative death at 30 days were 34% (95% CI 20–52) and 0% (95% CI 0–5) respectively. <h3>Conclusion</h3> One randomized trial suggests that HIPEC at time of interval cytoreductive surgery should be considered in patients with primary EOC. However, there is significant heterogeneity in literature with respect to an appropriate HIPEC regimen, short- and long-term outcomes. High-quality prospective randomized trials are urgently needed to clarify the role of HIPEC in the first-line treatment of primary EOC.",0

Essential data including scaffold fabrication material and methods, drug dosage and release duration and its effect on the cancer cells were extracted.15 articles out of 60 screened, fulfilled the eligibility criteria. Among the 15 studies, 5 studies included only cell lines and 2 studies were on mouse models, while 8 studies involved a combination of cell lines and mouse models. Scaffold materials included both synthetic polymers such as poly-lactide, polycaprolactone and natural materials including d-periosteum and human micro-fragmented adipose tissueA wide number of other variables included the fabrication procedure, drugs used, and the methods used to assess the effects on cancer. As a result, it was not possible to make any direct comparison of the efficacy of the therapeutic strategy used in each of these studies.Irrespective of the many variables, a common consensus in all the included studies was that scaffold mediated localized drug delivery effectively reduced cancer cell viability by increasing drug bioavailability to the target tissue, while its localized effect reduced the risk of systemic toxicity.",0
https://doi.org/10.1007/s10286-020-00683-4,Cardiovascular autonomic effects of electronic cigarette use: a systematic review,"Abstract Purpose Electronic cigarettes (ECs) are the fastest growing tobacco product in the USA, and ECs, like tobacco cigarettes (TCs), have effects on the cardiovascular autonomic nervous system, with clinical implications. The purpose of this review was to collect and synthesize available studies that have investigated the autonomic cardiovascular effects of EC use in humans. Special attention is paid to the acute and chronic effects of ECs, the relative contributions of the nicotine versus non-nicotine constituents in EC emissions and the relative effects of ECs compared to TCs. Methods Using the methodology described in the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) statement, we conducted a literature search of the Ovid PubMed and Embase databases on 6 December 2019 using keywords in titles and abstracts of published literature. Acute (minutes to hours) and chronic (days or longer) changes in heart rate variability (HRV), heart rate (HR) and blood pressure (BP) were used as estimates of cardiovascular autonomic effects. Results Nineteen studies were included in this systematic review, all of which used earlier generation EC devices. Acute EC vaping increased HR and BP less than acute TC smoking. Nicotine but not non-nicotine constituents in EC aerosol were responsible for the sympathoexcitatory effects. The results of chronic EC vaping studies were consistent with a chronic sympathoexcitatory effect as estimated by HRV, but this did not translate into chronic increases in HR or BP. Conclusions Electronic cigarettes are sympathoexcitatory. Cardiac sympathoexcitatory effects are less when vaping using the earlier generation ECs than when smoking TCs. Additional studies of the latest pod-like EC devices, which deliver nicotine similarly to a TC, are necessary.",0

This systematic review and meta-analysis was conducted in order to comprehensively investigate the relationship between receipt of statins and risk of MM. Patients and Methods Potentially eligible studies that compared the risk of MM between statin recipients and those who did not receive statins were identified from Medline and Embase databases from inception to August 2019 using a search strategy that comprised terms for “statin” and “multiple myeloma.” To be eligible, cohort studies must have recruited 2 groups of participants, statin recipients and nonrecipients, and followed their participants for incident MM. Eligible case–control studies must have recruited cases of MM and controls without MM, and must have explored the history of receipt of statins. Relative risk, hazard risk ratio, standardized incidence ratio, or odds ratio (OR) of this association must be reported. Relative risk and standard error from each study were extracted and combined using random-effect generic inverse variance. Relative risk of cohort study was used as an estimate for OR to calculate the pooled effect estimate along with the OR of the case–control studies. Results A total of 1744 articles were identified using the search strategy, and 10 studies were included in the meta-analysis. The odds of MM were significantly lower among statin recipients than nonrecipients, with a pooled OR of 0.80 (95% confidence interval, 0.68-0.93; I2 72%). The funnel plot was relatively symmetrical and did not suggest publication bias. Conclusion Receipt of statins is associated with a significant 20% reduction in the odds of MM.",0
https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph17093099,"Concentration, Spatial Distribution, Contamination Degree and Human Health Risk Assessment of Heavy Metals in Urban Soils across China between 2003 and 2019—A Systematic Review","This study provides an overview of the studies of heavy metal pollution regarding As, Cd, Cr, Hg, Pb, Cu, Zn and Ni in the urban soils throughout 71 cities of China, based on data from online literature, during the period 2003–2019. The concentrations, spatial distributions, contamination degrees and health risks of heavy metals in the urban soils were evaluated. The results demonstrated that the mean values of eight heavy metals all exceeded the soil background values in China, and the kriging interpolation method showed that the hot-spot cities with heavy metal contamination in urban soils were mainly concentrated in the southwest, southcentral, southeast coast, northcentral and northwest regions of China. The geoaccumulation index (Igeo) indicated that Hg and Cd were at moderate contamination levels and that the levels of the other six metals did not appear contamination. The pollution index (PI) showed that Cd and Hg reached high contamination levels, and the other metals reached moderate contamination levels. The integrated pollution index (IPI) and potential ecological risk index (PRI) indicated that the integral urban soils in the study areas ranked high contamination levels and moderate ecological risk degree, respectively, and Cd and Hg should be labeled as priority metals for control in the urban soils around China. The human health risk assessments for the heavy metals indicated that ingestion was the dominant exposure pathway for having adverse effects on human health. The mean Hazard index (HI) values of eight heavy metals all showed that adverse effects on human health were unlikely, and the mean carcinogenic (CR) values of As, Cr and Ni for children and adults all suggested an acceptable carcinogenic risk to human beings. In addition, children exposed to these heavy metals faced more serious non-carcinogenic and carcinogenic health threats compared to adults. The results could provide valuable information for demanding the better control of heavy metal pollution and mitigation of the adverse effects on residents by environmental regulators in national urban regions.",0

Results From an initial screen of 433 titles, two randomized trials and 24 observational studies provided clinical outcome data on the use of antiretroviral drugs; most studies reported outcomes using LPV/r as treatment. Of the 21 observational studies reporting treatment outcomes, there were three studies among patients with SARS, six studies among patients with MERS and 12 studies among patients with COVID-19. In one randomized trial 99 patients with severe COVID-19 illness were randomized to receive LPV/r (400/100 mg twice a day) and 100 patients to standard of care for 14 days: LPV/r was not associated with a statistically significant difference in time to clinical improvement, although LPV/r given within 12 days of symptoms was associated with shorter time to clinical improvement; 28 day mortality was numerically lower in the LPV/r group (14/99) compared to the control group (25/100), but this difference was not statistically significant. The second trial found no benefit. The certainty of the evidence for the randomized trials was low. In the observational studies 3 out of 361 patients who received LPV/r died; the certainty of evidence was very low. Three studies reported a possible protective effect of LPV/r as post-exposure prophylaxis. Again, the certainty of the evidence was very low due to uncertainty due to limited sample size. Conclusions On the basis of the available evidence it is uncertain whether LPV/r and other antiretrovirals improve clinical outcomes or prevent infection among patients at high risk of acquiring COVID-19.",0

After study selection and data extraction, the meta-analysis was conducted using Stata software version 12.0 (StataCorp LP, College Station, Texas). The evaluation of the methodological quality was carried out by AMSTAR 2 (Bruyère Research Institute, Ottawa, Ontario, Canada).A total of 23 observational studies involving 1,253,035 participants were included. The meta-analysis showed that prenatal exposure to antibiotics was not significantly associated with childhood overweight or obesity, whereas an increased risk of overweight or obesity was seen in subgroup analysis of the second trimester (risk ratio = 1.13; 95% CI: 1.06-1.22; P = 0.001). In contrast, antibiotic exposure during infancy could increase the risk of childhood overweight or obesity (risk ratio = 1.14; 95% CI: 1.06-1.23; P = 0.001).This meta-analysis found that antibiotic exposure during the second trimester and infancy could increase the risk of childhood overweight or obesity.",0

Service learning (SL) is a specific pedagogy that can provide pharmacy students with live patient interaction and foster community engagement. Although SL is recommended by educational standards, it is not clearly known if students or patients recognize the benefits of these activities. The objectives of this review are to assess student and patient perceptions of SL in the literature, evaluate the different approaches to SL, and describe interprofessional education (IPE) within SL.A literature search was conducted using the Scopus, PubMed, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL), ProQuest, Cochrane Review, Academic Search Complete, PsycInfo, and Google Scholar databases. Search terms included ""service learning"" AND ""pharmacy education OR learning"" AND ""perceptions."" Studies were included if they described perceptions of SL in pharmacy education. No timeline restrictions were made.Fourteen studies were included with SL occurring in didactic, co-curricular, and experiential pharmacy education. Student perceptions were consistently positive and expressed improvements in confidence, knowledge, and abilities. Patient perceptions, when evaluated, were also positive. SL provided a strong and trusting learning environment for IPE.SL is a beneficial component in all aspects of pharmacy education. Student and patient perceptions suggest that SL can enhance knowledge and improve overall health outcomes. Incorporating IPE into SL offers benefits to all healthcare professional students.",0
https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jclinepi.2020.01.008,A full systematic review was completed in 2 weeks using automation tools: a case study,"Abstract Background and Objectives Systematic reviews (SRs) are time and resource intensive, requiring approximately 1 year from protocol registration to submission for publication. Our aim was to describe the process, facilitators, and barriers to completing the first 2-week full SR. Study Design and Setting We systematically reviewed evidence of the impact of increased fluid intake, on urinary tract infection (UTI) recurrence, in individuals at risk for UTIs. The review was conducted by experienced systematic reviewers with complementary skills (two researcher clinicians, an information specialist, and an epidemiologist), using Systematic Review Automation tools, and blocked off time for the duration of the project. The outcomes were time to complete the SR, time to complete individual SR tasks, facilitators and barriers to progress, and peer reviewer feedback on the SR manuscript. Times to completion were analyzed quantitatively (minutes and calendar days); facilitators and barriers were mapped onto the Theoretical Domains Framework; and peer reviewer feedback was analyzed quantitatively and narratively. Results The SR was completed in 61 person-hours (9 workdays; 12 calendar days); accepted version of the manuscript required 71 person-hours. Individual SR tasks ranged from 16 person-minutes (deduplication of search results) to 461 person-minutes (data extraction). The least time-consuming SR tasks were obtaining full-texts, searches, citation analysis, data synthesis, and deduplication. The most time-consuming tasks were data extraction, write-up, abstract screening, full-text screening, and risk of bias. Facilitators and barriers mapped onto the following domains: knowledge; skills; memory, attention, and decision process; environmental context and resources; and technology and infrastructure. Two sets of peer reviewer feedback were received on the manuscript: the first included 34 comments requesting changes, 17 changes were made, requiring 173 person-minutes; the second requested 13 changes, and eight were made, requiring 121 person-minutes. Conclusion A small and experienced systematic reviewer team using Systematic Review Automation tools who have protected time to focus solely on the SR can complete a moderately sized SR in 2 weeks.",0

In this meta-analysis, we aimed to associate, for the first time, the prognosis in cancer patients with intratumoral expression of PIWI family proteins.PubMed, Embase, and Web of Knowledge databases were searched, and studies investigating the association between intratumoral mRNA or protein expression of different PIWI family proteins and survival, metastasis, or recurrence of various cancer types were reviewed. Study qualities were assessed using the REMARK criteria. Studies' heterogeneity was evaluated using I2 index and Cochran Q test. Publication bias was assessed by funnel plots and Egger's regression. Pooled hazard ratios (HR) with 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) were calculated for different PIWI family proteins separately. Specifically, log of calculated HR was pooled using random-effects model.Twenty-six studies (4299 participants) were included. The pooled HR of mortality in high versus low expression of PIWIL1, PIWIL2, and PIWIL4 was 1.87 (95% CI: 1.31-2.66, p < 0.05), 1.09 (95% CI: 0.58-2.07, p = 0.79), and 0.44 (95% CI: 0.25-0.76, p < 0.05), respectively. The pooled HR of recurrence in high versus low expression of PIWIL1 and PIWIL2 was 1.72 (95% CI: 1.20-2.49, p < 0.05) and 1.98 (95% CI: 0.65-5.98, p = 0.23), respectively.Highly variable results were observed for different cancer types. Higher PIWIL1 and lower piwil4 and PIWIL4 expression levels could potentially indicate worse prognosis in cancer. These proteins' expressions could be used for personalized prognosis and treatment in the future.",0

A number of SARS-CoV-2 positive pregnant women have been reported. However, more information is still needed on the pregnancy outcome and the neonates regarding COVID-19 pneumonia.A systematic search was done and nine articles on COVID-19 pneumonia and SARS-CoV-2 positive pregnant women were extracted. Some maternal-fetal characteristics were extracted to be included in the meta-analysis.The present meta-analysis was conducted on 87 SARS-CoV-2 positive pregnant women. Almost 65% of the patients reported a history of exposure to an infected person, 78% suffered from mild or moderate COVID-19, 99.9% had successful termination, 86% had cough, and 68% had fever (p = .022 and p < .001). The overall proportions of vertical transmission, still birth, and neonatal death were zero, 0.002, and, 0.002, respectively (p = 1, p = .86, and p = .89, respectively). The means of the first- and fifth-minute Apgar scores were 8.86 and 9, respectively (p < .001 for both). The confounding role of history of underlying diseases with an estimated overall proportion of 33% (p = .03) resulted in further investigations due to sample size limitation. A natural history of COVID-19 pneumonia in the adult population was presented, as well.Currently, no evidence of vertical transmission has been suggested at least in late pregnancy. No hazards have been detected for fetuses or neonates. Although pregnant women are at an immunosuppressive state due to the physiological changes during pregnancy, most patients suffered from mild or moderate COVID-19 pneumonia with no pregnancy loss, proposing a similar pattern of the clinical characteristics of COVID-19 pneumonia to that of other adult populations.",0
https://doi.org/10.1007/s00455-020-10112-3,Radiation Safety in Videofluoroscopic Swallowing Study: Systematic Review,"Videofluoroscopic swallowing study (VFSS) is generally used to diagnose dysphagia and oropharyngeal aspiration during swallowing movement. Patients and bolus-feeding operators (such as occupational therapist and speech language pathologist) may undergo multiple VFSS procedure, placing them at risk for more radiation exposure due to increased scan time. The present study investigated the dose–area product, effective dose of various protocols, and summarized dose reports from various studies of VFSS. The PubMed database searched for relevant publications reporting radiation dose in the VFSS procedure. 13 articles were selected to be reviewed. This systematic review involved 13 peer-reviewed articles that reported the specific dose of the VFSS procedure. The articles were categorized into three types: operator radiation dose, adult patient radiation dose, and pediatric radiation dose. The operator dose reports showed that the operators’ scattering exposure, equivalent dose (across the whole body, eyes, and hands), and annual effective dose were significantly lower than the annual dose limit of 20 mSv. Both adult and pediatric patient dose reports showed that the effective dose, which was estimated from recorded dose–area product, was significantly lower than the annual background exposure of 2.4 mSv in various protocols. The present literature review suggested that the radiation dose of VFSS by modified barium swallowing is acceptable in both operators and patients. However, various radiation protection strategies should be conducted during the procedure to reduce the risk of stochastic effect.",0

Immunotherapy is emerging as a novel therapeutic approach. This systematic review assesses clinical data regarding immunotherapy efficacy and safety.Data from 11 clinical trials testing immunotherapy in HNSCC were assessed. We performed the meta-analysis to correlate the overall survival (OS), response rate (RR), adverse effects, HPV status, and PD-L1 expression.Immunotherapy extended OS (hazard ratio = 0.77, p < 0.0001) and RR significantly (risk ratio = 1.41, p = 0.02). Patients with HPV-positive HNSCC exhibited a better RR (risk ratio = 1.29, p = 0.24) and OS (11.5 vs. 6.3 months). PD-L1 positive tumors showed a higher OS (9.9 vs. 6.5 months). Moreover, immunotherapy caused less adverse effects than standard therapy.Our results indicate the benefit of immunotherapy for improving RR and OS of HNSCC patients. The benefit is higher in patients with HPV and PD-L1 positive tumors.",0

Trials comparing behavioral or pharmacological interventions with no or a minimal tobacco use intervention control group (eg, usual care, attention control, wait list) were included.One investigator abstracted data and a second investigator checked data abstraction for accuracy. Two investigators independently assessed study quality. Studies were pooled using random-effects meta-analysis.Tobacco use initiation; tobacco use cessation; health outcomes; harms.Twenty-four randomized clinical trials (N = 44 521) met inclusion criteria. Behavioral interventions were associated with decreased likelihood of cigarette smoking initiation compared with control interventions at 7 to 36 months' follow-up (13 trials, n = 21 700; 7.4% vs 9.2%; relative risk [RR], 0.82 [95% CI, 0.73-0.92]). There was no statistically significant difference between behavioral interventions and controls in smoking cessation when trials were restricted to smokers (9 trials, n = 2516; 80.7% vs 84.1% continued smoking; RR, 0.97 [95% CI, 0.93-1.01]). There were no significant benefits of medication on likelihood of smoking cessation in 2 trials of bupropion at 26 weeks (n = 523; 17% [300 mg] and 6% [150 mg] vs 10% [placebo]; 24% [150 mg] vs 28% [placebo]) and 1 trial of nicotine replacement therapy at 12 months (n = 257; 8.1% vs 8.2%). One trial each (n = 2586 and n = 1645) found no beneficial intervention effect on health outcomes or on adult smoking. No trials of prevention in young adults were identified. Few trials addressed prevention or cessation of tobacco products other than cigarettes; no trials evaluated effects of interventions on e-cigarette use. There were few trials of pharmacotherapy, and they had small sample sizes.Behavioral interventions may reduce the likelihood of smoking initiation in nonsmoking children and adolescents. Research is needed to identify effective behavioral interventions for adolescents who smoke cigarettes or who use other tobacco products and to understand the effectiveness of pharmacotherapy.",0
https://doi.org/10.1007/s40211-020-00349-7,Lack of research on efficacy of virtual reality exposure therapy (VRET) for anxiety disorders in children and adolescents,"Summary Anxiety disorders are one of the most prevalent mental disorders in children and adolescents which may effectively be treated by several forms of exposure therapy. An emerging approach to exposure is virtual reality exposure therapy (VRET), but a literature search synthesis focusing specifically on the use of VRET in children and adolescents is still lacking. This systematic review sets out to provide an overview concerning VRET for the treatment of anxiety disorders in this age group. Four published trials covering an overall sample of 100 participants between the ages of 8 and 16 years were found during a systematic literature search and were included in the current review. Results reveal that participants show clinical improvements regarding anxiety symptoms after VRET. Nevertheless, the high potential of virtual reality as a tool for treating children and adolescents with anxiety disorders is contrasted by a considerable lack of controlled trials. Despite the evidence of VRET in adult samples, there is a need for more research with younger cohorts in order to be able to support this promising field of application.",0
https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bbi.2019.02.027,Neuropsychiatric consequences of childhood group A streptococcal infection: A systematic review of preclinical models,"In recent years, clinical studies have shown strong epidemiological evidence of an increased risk of developing neuropsychiatric disorders after childhood exposure to streptococcal infection, including the Pediatric Autoimmune Neuropsychiatric Disorders Associated with Streptococcal infection (PANDAS). New preclinical studies on group A streptococcus (GAS) exposure investigate how to disentangle the influences of immune activation to induce long-term neurobehavioral effects associated with neuropsychiatric disorders such as obsessive-compulsive disorder, schizophrenia or autism. The present systematic review collects neurobehavioral evidence regarding the use of GAS exposure in animal models to study the vulnerability to different neuropsychiatric disorders, improving our understanding of its possible causes and consequences, and compares its contribution with other preclinical models of immune activation in a variety of paradigms. Specifically, we reviewed the effects of postnatal GAS exposure, in comparison with post- and prenatal exposure to Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and Polyinosinic:polycytidylic acid (Poly I:C), on the long-term effects concerning psychomotor, cognition and socioemotional outcomes in rodents. GAS exposure in animal models has revealed different behavioral alterations such as reduced locomotion and motor coordination, a deficit in sensorimotor gating, learning, working memory, altered social behavior, and increased anxiety and stereotyped behavior. Most of the results found are in accordance with other immune activation models -LPS and Poly I:C-, with some discrepancies. The systematic review of the literature supports the preclinical model of GAS exposure as a valid model for studying the neurobehavioral consequences of streptococcal infections. Future studies on streptococcal infection could contribute increasing our knowledge on preventive actions or treatments for neuropsychiatric disorders.",0

Myocarditis and cardiomyopathy are the most serious cardiac adverse drug reactions although reported rates of these conditions vary in the literature. We systematically reviewed and meta-analysed the event rates, the absolute death rates and case fatality rates of myocarditis and cardiomyopathy associated with clozapine. Methods: PubMed, EMBASE and PsycINFO were searched for studies that reported on the incidence of cardiomyopathy or myocarditis in people exposed to clozapine. Data were meta-analysed using a random effects model, with subgroup analysis on study size, time frame, region, quality, retrospective vs prospective, and diagnostic criteria of myocarditis or cardiomyopathy. Results: 28 studies of 258,961 people exposed to clozapine were included. The event rate of myocarditis was 0.007 (95% confidence interval [CI] = [0.003, 0.016]), absolute death rate was 0.0004 (95% CI = [0.0002, 0.0009]) and case fatality rate was 0.127 (95% CI = [0.034, 0.377]). The cardiomyopathy event rate was 0.006 (95% CI = [0.002, 0.023]), absolute death rate was 0.0003 (95% CI = [0.0001, 0.0012]) and case fatality rate was 0.078 (95% CI = [0.018, 0.285]). Few included studies provided information on criteria for diagnosis of myocarditis and cardiomyopathy. Event rates of cardiomyopathy and myocarditis were higher in Australia. Conclusion: Clarity of diagnostic criteria for myocarditis remains a challenge. Observation bias may, in part, influence higher reported rates in Australia. Monitoring for myocarditis is warranted in the first 4 weeks, and treatment of comorbid metabolic syndrome and diabetes may reduce the risk of cardiomyopathy. The risks of myocarditis and cardiomyopathy are low and should not present a barrier to people with treatment refractory schizophrenia being offered a monitored trial of clozapine.",0
https://doi.org/10.1002/hon.2706,Characteristics and risk factors of bortezomib induced peripheral neuropathy: A systematic review of phase III trials,"Bortezomib-induced peripheral neuropathy (BIPN) is a common toxicity associated with the treatment of multiple myeloma (MM), typically requiring dose reduction, delay, or cessation of treatment protocol. This systematic review aimed to investigate risk factors, trends, and variability associated with the development of BIPN. Searches were undertaken using Medline, PubMed, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Embase, Scopus, and Web of Science. Additional studies were identified by investigating authors' bibliographic references cited by original and review articles. Articles that reported on neuropathy in phase III randomised control trials involving bortezomib in any treatment arm for the treatment of MM were included in this review. A total of 43 full text articles met criteria, which examined 23 phase III trials (N = 8218). Overall incidence of neuropathy ranged from 8.4% to 80.5% (median = 37.8%) and severe neuropathy (grade 3-4) ranged from 1% to 33.2% (median = 8%). Similar reports of neuropathy of any grade and severe neuropathy were observed between the newly diagnosed and relapsed cohort. Bortezomib regimens with reduced dose intensity were associated with reduced neuropathy incidence. Increased cumulative dosing levels, intravenous compared with subcutaneous administration and combination therapy with thalidomide were associated with higher rates of BIPN. This analysis revealed that BIPN is a significant toxicity. More sensitive measures are required to capture the incidence and severity of BIPN. Better understanding of risk factors and reversibility profiles will minimise the number of cancer survivors living with residual treatment side effects.",0

However, the effect of gender on the chemotherapeutic response and oncologic outcomes after radical cystectomy (RC) and perioperative chemotherapy remains to be elucidated. We performed a systematic literature search to identify eligible studies that had investigated the effect of gender on the chemotherapeutic response and oncologic outcomes after RC and perioperative chemotherapy. We identified 15 studies reported from 2008 to 2019. For the patients who had received neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC), female gender was not associated with a complete response (pooled odds ratio [OR], 0.94; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.69-1.26) nor a complete or partial response (pooled OR, 0.96; 95% CI, 0.73-1.27). In addition, women experienced had less upstaging (pooled OR, 0.3; 95% CI, 0.14-0.68) at RC compared with their male counterparts. Moreover, female patients who had undergone RC and NAC were likely to have better disease recurrence and cancer-specific mortality rates than were the male patients (pooled hazard ratio [HR], 0.66 and 95% CI, 0.44-0.98; and pooled HR, 0.49 and 95% CI, 0.29-0.81, respectively). For the patients who had undergone adjuvant chemotherapy, female gender was not associated with overall mortality (pooled HR, 1.15; 95% CI, 0.7-1.89), disease recurrence (pooled HR, 0.95; 95% CI, 0.74-1.23), or cancer-specific mortality (pooled HR, 1.07; 95% CI, 0.81-1.43). Female patients with BCa seem to benefit more from NAC than do their male counterparts. This potential differential sensitivity of female BCa to cisplatin-based combination chemotherapy might help close the gender gap in BCa, suggesting that gender could be a biomarker to help select the best systemic therapy for patients with advanced BCa.",0
https://doi.org/10.1007/s00394-020-02240-1,Reducing postprandial glucose in dietary intervention studies and the magnitude of the effect on diabetes-related risk factors: a systematic review and meta-analysis,"Abstract Purpose Reducing postprandial hyperglycemia has beneficial effects on diabetes-related risk factors, but the magnitude of the reduction needed to achieve such an effect is unknown. The purpose of the study was to quantify the relationship of acute glucose and insulin postprandial responses with longer-term effects on diabetes-related risk factors by performing a systematic review and meta-analysis of dietary intervention studies. Methods We systematically searched EMBASE and MEDLINE. Dietary intervention studies among any human population aiming to reduce postprandial glycemia, with actual measures of postprandial glucose (PPG) and/or insulin (PPI) as acute exposures (incremental area under the curve, iAUC) as well as markers of glucose metabolism (fasting glucose, HbA1c) and insulin sensitivity (fasting insulin, HOMA-IR) after at least 4 weeks of diet intervention as outcomes were included. Meta-analyses were performed for the effects on acute exposures and on diabetes-related risk factors. The relationship between changes in acute exposures and changes in risk factor outcomes was estimated by meta-regression analyses. Results Out of the 13,004 screened papers, 13 papers with 14 comparisons were included in the quantitative analysis. The dietary interventions acutely reduced mean PPG [mean difference (MD), − 0.27 mmol/l; 95% CI − 0.41 to − 0.14], but not mean PPI (MD − 7.47 pmol/l; 95% CI − 16.79 to 1.86). There were no significant overall effects on fasting glucose and insulin. HbA1c was reduced by − 0.20% (95% CI − 0.35 to − 0.05). Changes in acute PPG were significantly associated with changes in fasting plasma glucose (FPG) [per 10% change in PPG: β = 0.085 (95% CI 0.003, 0.167), k = 14], but not with fasting insulin [ β = 1.20 (95% CI − 0.32, 2.71), k = 12]. Changes in acute PPI were not associated with changes in FPG [per 10% change in PPI: β = − 0.017 (95% CI − 0.056, 0.022), k = 11]. Conclusions Only a limited number of postprandial glucose-lowering dietary intervention studies measured acute postprandial exposures to PPG/PPI during the interventions. In this small heterogeneous set of studies, an association was found between the magnitude of the acute postprandial responses and the change in fasting glucose, but no other outcomes. More studies are needed to quantify the relationship between acute postprandial changes and long-term effects on risk factors.",0
https://doi.org/10.3390/diagnostics10050271,The Effects of Early Bispectral Index to Predict Poor Neurological Function in Cardiac Arrest Patients: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis,"The diagnostic performance of the bispectral index (BIS) to early predict neurological outcomes in patients achieving return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) after cardiac arrest (CA) remained unclear. We searched PubMed, EMBASE, Scopus and CENTRAL for relevant studies through October 2019. Methodologic quality was assessed using the Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies-2 (QUADAS-2) tool. Meta-analysis was performed using a linear mixed-effects model to the log-transformed data with a logistic distribution assumption. Bivariate meta-regression was performed to explore heterogeneity. In total, 13 studies with 999 CA adult patients were included. At the optimal threshold of 32, BIS obtained within 72 h of ROSC elicits a pooled sensitivity of 84.9% (95% confidence interval (CI), 71.1% to 92.7%), a pooled specificity of 85.9% (95% CI, 71.2% to 93.8%) and an area under the curve of 0.92. Moreover, a BIS cutoff &lt; 12 yielded a pooled specificity of 95.0% (95% CI, 77.8% to 99.0%). In bivariate meta-regression, the timing of neurological outcome assessment, the adoption of targeted temperature management, and the administration of sedative agents or neuromuscular blocking agents (NMBA) were not identified as the potential source of heterogeneity. BIS retains good diagnostic performance during targeted temperature management (TTM) and in the presence of administrated sedative agents and NMBA. In conclusion, BIS can predict poor neurological outcomes early in patients with ROSC after CA with good diagnostic performance and should be incorporated into the neuroprognostication strategy algorithm.",0

In this systematic review and meta-analysis, we aimed to review the available literature to find the prevalence of cardiovascular comorbidities and their association with sarcoidosis. <h3>Methods</h3> An electronic search was conducted through nine databases for articles reporting cardiovascular comorbidities in sarcoidosis patients. We assessed the quality of each included article using the National Institute of Health quality assessment tool (NIH), while meta-analysis was used to pool the results. <h3>Results</h3> Out of 2208 reports screened, we included 14 studies. The most common cardiovascular comorbidities were hypertension 28.8%, heart failure 9.3% and non-specified arrhythmia 8.1%. There were significant association between sarcoidosis and heart failure and hypertension rather than controls (OR = 2.10, 95%CI (1.65 - 2.69), <i>p</i> < 0.01) and (OR = 1.27, 95%CI (1.02 - 1.59), <i>p</i> = 0.036), respectively. However, we found no association between sarcoidosis and cerebrovascular disease, ischemic heart disease and ventricular tachycardia (<i>p</i> > 0.05). <h3>Conclusion</h3> Sarcoidosis is associated with certain types of cardiovascular comorbidities. Timely diagnosis and aggressive management in this population are needed to minimize the hazards associated with the disease.",0
https://doi.org/10.1016/j.injury.2020.03.007,Surgical hand rubbing versus surgical hand scrubbing: Systematic review and meta-analysis of efficacy,"Abstract Background Surgical hand rubbing (SHR) and surgical hand scrubbing (SHS) are two common methods used by surgeons to reduce surgical site infections. To date, the optimal method that can effectively reduce these infections remains unknown. In this study, we performed a comprehensive statistical analysis to compare the efficacy of these two methods in effectively controlling surgical site infections. Methods A systemic review and meta-analysis was performed by mining literature from major databases, including Pubmed, Embase, Cochrane library, Ovid and Google Scholar, and recruiting studies published between 1980 and 1st April 2019. Analysis was performed using Revman, version 5.3, software, and focused on primary outcomes that included colony-forming unit (CFU) counts and logarithmic reduction of CFU after hand antisepsis and after surgery. Results Seven clinical trials met our inclusion criteria, with a total of 764 healthcare workers analyzed. We found no statistically significant differences between the two methods with regards to CFU counts and logarithmic reduction of CFU after hand antisepsis and surgery, as well as antisepsis and surgery times. Conclusion From the literature, it was evident that SHR had similar efficacy to SHS, without necessarily increasing costs. Owing to advantages such as ease of application, exposure to less dermal irritation, and less time consumption, SHR is recommended as a cost-effective alternative for management of surgical site infections.",0

Purpose The purpose of this systematic review was to provide information on the influence of surface and intrinsic titanium alloy chemical components on cell viability. Material and methods The PubMed, LILACS, COCHRANE library, and Science Direct databases were electronically searched for the terms dental implants AND titanium AND cytotoxicity. Inclusion criteria were research articles that studied titanium or its alloys for chemical composition and cell viability and were published in English between 1999 and 2019. Articles that did not study titanium and its alloys, articles with nondental or biomedical implants, and articles that were not found in their entirety were excluded. Results A total of 1226 articles selected by title or abstract according to the inclusion and exclusion criteria resulted in 51 articles that were reduced to 27 after reading in full. The treatments analyzed were arc fusion, electron beam physical deposition, plasma electrolytic oxidation, coating addition, micro arc oxidation, anodization, thermochemical process, BMP-2 immobilization, pressure-assisted sintering, and alkali heat treatment. Conclusions The evaluated literature did not allow a determination of the best surface treatment for cell viability because of the heterogeneity of the studies regarding the type of alloy, cell used in the MTT assay, study, and implant purpose (biomedical or dental). The cytotoxic effect of chemical components was dependent on dose, time, size, temperature, and cell type. The niobium, tantalum, zirconium, and molybdenum elements have been most often added in the development of less toxic Ti alloys with lower modulus of elasticity and increased strength.",0
https://doi.org/10.1016/j.pec.2020.04.029,Effects of health coaching on behavioral modification among adults with cardiovascular risk factors: Systematic review and meta-analysis,"Abstract Objectives This meta-analysis examined effects of health coaching on physical activities, dietary behaviors, health responsibility, stress management, and smoking behaviors among populations with cardiovascular risk factors. Methods Multiple electronic databases were searched for randomized controlled trials utilizing health coaching for people with cardiovascular risk factors to lead behavioral changes. The included studies were pooled to estimate the effect size for health coaching interventions on each of the health behaviors. Results This meta-analysis included 15 randomized trials. Motivational interviewing and education sessions were common coaching interventions with telephone calls or face-to-face contacts as the main contact methods. Health coaching for health behaviors showed small but significant effect sizes on physical activities, dietary behaviors, health responsibility, and stress management except for smoking behaviors. Conclusion The study findings support that health coaching can induce positive behavioral changes among individuals with cardiovascular risk factors. Health coaching delivered by either expert or peer coaches would be easy to apply in clinical settings. Practical implications Health care professionals should be aware that health coaching could provide effective motivation strategies to improve compliance of those who need to initiate and maintain their health behaviors. Health coaching could be easily delivered via telephone calls, text messages, or short-term face-to-face coaching.",0

https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph17103362,Decision-Making Process in Female Genital Mutilation: A Systematic Review,"Female genital mutilation/cutting ""FGM/C"" is a deep-rooted damaging practice. Despite the growing efforts to end this practice, the current trends of its decline are not enough to overcome the population's underlying growth. The aim of this research is to investigate the FGM/C household decision-making process and identify the main household decision-makers. A review of peer-reviewed articles was conducted by searching PubMed, JSTOR, Ovid MEDLINE, Ovid EMBASE, EBSCO, and CINAHL Plus via systematic search using keywords. The found publications were screen using inclusion and exclusion criteria in line with Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. After critical appraisal, seventeen articles were included in this review. The data extracted from the articles regarding FGM/C household-decision making process and decision-makers were analyzed using narrative analysis. FGM/C decision-making process varies from a region to another; however, it generally involves more than one individual, and each one has different power over the decision. Fathers, mothers, and grandmothers are the main decision-makers. It was shown from this review that opening the dialogue regarding FGM/C between sexes may lead to a productive decision-making process. The participation of fathers in the decision-making may free the mothers from the social-pressure and responsibility of carrying on traditions and create a more favorable environment to stop FGM/C practice.",0

This review assessed published evidence on the effects of food environment interventions on anthropometric (BMI and weight status) outcomes in school-aged children (5-9 y) and adolescents (10-19 y) (SACA) in LMICs. We summarized randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi-experimental studies (QES) published since 2000 to August 2019 in the peer-reviewed and gray literature that assessed the effects of food-related behavioral and environmental interventions on diet-related health outcomes in SACA in LMICs. Electronic databases (MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, Cochrane Library) were searched using appropriate keywords, Medical Subject Headings, and free text terms. Eleven RCTs and 6 QES met the inclusion criteria, testing multicomponent behavioral and environmental interventions in schools. Analysis of 6 RCTs (n = 17,054) suggested an overall effect on change in BMI [mean difference (MD): -0.11, 95% CI: -0.19 , -0.03], whereas there was no observed effect in 5 studies using endline BMI (n = 17,371) (MD: 0.05, 95% CI: -0.32, 0.21). There was no significant pooled effect among the 3 QES (n = 5,023) that reported differences in change in BMI or endline (MD: -0.37, 95% CI: -0.95, 0.22). There is limited evidence to support the modification of diet-related health outcomes through school-based food environment interventions in SACA in LMICs. Further studies are needed to understand the impact of school and community-based food environment interventions on nutritional status in this population.",1

Design Meta-analysis. Methods This review was conducted and reported in accordance with PRISMA and pre-registered with PROSPERO. Articles were retrieved via online database search engines, with no date or language restriction. Studies investigating current field-based athletes (>18years) for CVD risk factors according to the European Society of Cardiology and American Heart Association were screened. Full texts were screened using Covidence and Cochrane criteria. Eligible articles were critically appraised using the AXIS tool. Individual study estimates were assessed by random-effect meta-analyses to examine the overall effect. Results This study was ascribed a 1b evidence level, according to the Oxford Centre for Evidence-based Medicine. 41 studies were identified, including 5546 athletes from four sports; American football; soccer; rugby and baseball mean ages: 18–28. Despite participation in sport, increased body mass was associated with increased total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein, triglycerides, hypertension, systolic blood pressure, and decreased high-density lipoprotein. Linemen had increased prevalence of hypertension compared to non-athletes. Conflicting findings on fasting glucose were prevalent. There were inconsistencies in screening and reporting of CVD risk factors. Sport specific anthropometric demands were associated with elevated prevalence of CVD risk factors, most notably: elevated body mass; dyslipidemia; elevated systolic blood pressure and; glucose. Conclusions There are elevated levels of risk for CVD in some athletes, primarily football players. Lifestyle behaviours associated with elite athleticism, particularly football linemen potentially expose players to greater metabolic and CVD risk, which is not completely offset by sport participation.",0

A systematic review,"Sedentary behavior (SB) has emerged as a potential risk factor for chronic diseases. SB includes activities requiring low energy expenditure (≤1.5 metabolic equivalents) performed in a sitting or reclining posture. Our study aimed to gather evidence on the association between SB outcomes in adolescents (10-19 years) and neighborhood characteristics. This systematic review (PROSPERO registration number: CRD42018076877) examined studies indexed in PubMed Central®, LILACS, ScienceDirect, and SPORTDiscus databases. Sixteen articles were included. Insecurity during daytime hours, crime incidence, physical and social disorders, a higher neighborhood socioeconomic level, and time spent with peers were associated with higher levels of SB. Traffic, availability of a favorable environment for physical activity, and higher residential density were associated with lower levels of SB. Despite great variability in the SB cutoff points and methodology used for evaluating SB and neighborhood characteristics among studies, the evidence suggests that adolescent SB might be influenced by neighborhood characteristics.",0

The PUBMED, Web of Science, Cochrane Library, and Scopus databases were searched in December 2019 according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-analysis statement. Studies were deemed eligible if they compared patients with HSPC with normal and low Hb levels to determine their ability to predict overall survival, cancer-specific survival, progression-free survival, and castration-resistant prostate cancer-free survival. Formal meta-analyses were performed for these outcomes. The systematic review identified 25 studies including 6614 patients; 21 studies comprising 5782 patients were eligible for meta-analysis. Low Hb levels were associated with worse overall survival (pooled hazard ratio [HR], 1.21; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.15-1.29), cancer-specific survival (pooled HR, 1.46; 95% CI, 1.24-1.72), progression-free survival (pooled HR, 1.21; 95% CI, 1.14-1.28), and castration-resistant prostate cancer-free survival (pooled HR, 1.37; 95% CI: 1.18-1.57). Subgroup analyses revealed that low Hb levels were also associated with poor overall survival in patients with both ""high-volume"" (pooled HR, 1.49; 95% CI, 1.29-1.72) and ""low-volume"" HSPC (pooled HR, 1.40; 95% CI, 1.13-1.73). This meta-analysis revealed that low Hb serum levels in patients with metastatic HSPC were associated with increased risks of overall mortality, cancer-specific mortality, disease progression, and biochemical recurrence. Furthermore, Hb levels were independently associated with overall survival in the ""high-volume"" and ""low-volume"" HSPC subgroups. Therefore, it might be useful to incorporate Hb testing into prognostic tools for metastatic HSPC.",0

They can either reduce the risk of medical error during transitions of care or cause direct medical or financial harm to patients due to poor communication. To review (1) observational studies that quantify the frequency of transfer of specific data points or clinician retention of information provided in prehospital verbal handoff to assess the state of EMS-to-ED handoffs; (2) surveys and interviews of prehospital and ED staff perceptions of the handover process and any perceived barriers to optimal handover found therein; (3) interventional studies that have aimed to improve the quality of EMS to ED handoffs. A systematic review of the literature was performed using Pubmed, Web of Science, Google Scholar, and Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews and by hand-searching references of relevant articles. Articles were selected that focused on verbal and/or written handover of patient care from EMS to ED providers and that addressed the above goals. Qualitative data was extracted from the articles and assessed using thematic synthesis. 78 articles were identified for full text review, 60 of which met inclusion criteria. Four categories of barriers emerged on thematic synthesis: educational, operational, cultural, and cognitive. Within these categories, 12 initial descriptive themes and 9 suggested interventions were identified. Descriptive themes of disrespect & disinterest, environmental factors, redundancy, poor recall, conflicting goals and perspectives, technological issues, information degradation, information loss, lack of standardization, lack of training, delays, and lack of feedback were identified as barriers to effective EMS to ED handovers. Three categories of interventions were identified across the included interventional studies, namely technological, educational, and changes to cultural customs.",0
https://doi.org/10.1016/j.euo.2018.12.011,Nonsurgical Salvage Local Therapies for Radiorecurrent Prostate Cancer: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis,"Abstract Context Different nonsurgical therapeutic strategies can be adopted for intraprostatic relapse of prostate cancer after primary radiotherapy, including re-irradiation (with brachytherapy [BT] or external beam radiotherapy [EBRT]), high-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU), and cryotherapy. The main issues to consider when choosing nonsurgical salvage local therapies are local tumor control and significant genitourinary toxicity. Objective To conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis of the role of nonsurgical salvage modalities in patients with radiorecurrent prostate cancer and associated clinical outcomes and toxicity profiles. Evidence acquisition We performed a critical review of the Medline, Scopus, and ClinicalKey databases from January 1, 2000 through February 1, 2018 according to the Preferred Reporting Items and Meta-Analyses statement. To assess the overall quality of the literature reviewed, we used a modified Delphi tool for case-series studies. Evidence synthesis A total of 64 case-series studies were included, corresponding to a cohort of 5585 patients. The modified Delphi checklist evidenced high methodological quality overall (mean quality score of 80.6%). Biochemical control rates were lowest for patients treated with HIFU (58%, 95% confidence interval [CI] 47–68%) and highest for patients treated with BT (69%, 95% CI 62–76%) and EBRT (69%, 95% CI 53–83%). The lowest prevalence of incontinence was for patients treated with BT (3%, 95% CI 0–6%; I2 = 63.4%) and the highest was among patients treated with HIFU (28%, 95% CI 19–38%; I2 = 89.7%). Conclusions Nonsurgical therapeutic options, especially BT, showed good outcomes in terms of biochemical control and tolerability in the local recurrence setting. Patient summary The current analysis demonstrated that nonsurgical salvage local therapies offer a chance of a curative local approach in radiorecurrent prostate cancer. However, high-quality data from prospective trials are needed to validate long-term outcomes from nonsurgical strategies for the treatment of intraprostatic recurrence after previous radiotherapy.",0

The information sources were the Web of Science and WanFang Data Knowledge Service Platform electronic databases. Only journal articles reporting quantitative empirical research were selected. The eligibility criteria included studies with (1) interventions of any indoor plant, excluding biofilters that combine power facilities and vegetation, (2) comparators included within the same experimental treatment or between different experimental treatments, (3) air quality effects objectively measured using any instrument, and (4) any study design. Both authors screened 95 journal articles and compiled information according to (1) intervention (plant species, foliage, or medium), (2) scientific family name of each plant, (3) study design (experiment, field experiment, or survey), (4) air quality (e.g., temperature, humidity, negative ions, radiation, and dust), (5) pollutants, (6) research environment, (7) ventilation (types and rates), (8) climate (lighting, temperature, and humidity), (9) exposure duration, (10) sampling frequency or period, and (11) number of replications. The primary effects of the potential of the indoor plants on air quality were reduced pollutant levels (particularly formaldehyde, benzene, and toluene removal), followed by increase in humidity and decrease in temperature. In addition, including various plant species could improve the effects of indoor vegetation on ameliorating air quality and microclimate conditions.",0

Its prognostic value in non-ischemic dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) remains unclear. The purpose of this study was to synthetize available data and explore the prognostic value of T1 mapping in DCM. Methods We searched Pubmed, Embase, Cochrane Library and Scopus for cohort studies up to 28 March 2020 that reported prognostic data for cardiovascular magnetic resonance T1 mapping in patients with DCM. Hazard ratios (HRs) were pooled using random-effects meta-analysis. Values were expressed as standard deviation (SD) of normal controls. Heterogeneity was assessed with the I2 statistic. Results Eight studies were included in the meta-analysis, with a total of 1242 patients. Extracellular volume fraction (ECV) had high prognostic value for a composite outcome of mortality and morbidity with HR 1.38 (95% confidence interval, 1.18–1.61). Native T1 was also shown to have high prognostic value for a composite outcome of mortality and morbidity with HR 1.20 (95% confidence interval, 1.14–1.27). Heterogeneity was moderate for the ECV analysis (I2 = 64%). Conclusions ECV and native T1 could potentially be used to improve risk stratification in DCM. Future studies should investigate the prognostic value of T1 mapping by separating mortality and morbidity as primary outcomes and evaluate its incremental value in addition to standard risk stratification criteria.",0

This is the first systematic review and pooled analysis of surgical characteristics, risk factors, and outcomes of the RSAF. Methods A systematic literature review was conducted. All studies reporting on patients undergoing RSAF reconstruction and their outcomes were included. Outcomes were pooled and analyzed using Fisher exact or χ test. Results Forty-three studies (479 patients, 481 flaps) were analyzed. The majority of patients were male (70.3%), and average ± SD age was 46.9 ± 16.7 years. Rates of smoking, diabetes mellitus (DM), and peripheral vascular disease (PVD) were 34.6%, 35.4%, and 12.3%, respectively. Defect etiologies were largely traumatic (60.4%). The most common defect location was the heel (40.8%). Flap modifications were reported in 123 flaps (25.6%). The most common modification was adipofascial extension (20.3%).Overall, the partial and total flap loss rates were 15.4% and 3.1%, respectively. Partial flap loss was significantly increased in smokers (28.9% vs 12.2% in nonsmokers, P = 0.0195). Technical modifications decreased the odds of partial necrosis by almost 3-fold compared with traditional RSAF reconstruction (7.2% vs 17.9%; odds ratio, 2.8 [1.4-5.8]; P = 0.0035). Patient age, DM, and PVD were not significantly associated with flap loss. Conclusions The RSAF remains a safe salvage option for patients with DM or PVD but should be used with caution in smokers. Technical modifications to minimize pedicle compression significantly reduce rates of partial necrosis.",0

This study aims to systematically review the current literature on the association between season and month of birth with birth weight as well as with weight status in childhood. Methods The search process was conducted in electronic databases, including papers published until April 2019 in ISI Web of Science, PubMed, Scopus, and Google Scholar. The following search strategy was used with MeSH terms: (""Seasons""[Mesh]) AND (""Obesity""[Mesh] OR ""Pediatric Obesity""[Mesh] OR ""Obesity, Abdominal""[Mesh] OR ""Overweight""[Mesh] OR ""Birth Weight""[Mesh] OR ""Body Height""[Mesh]). After the selection process, 50 papers were included in this systematic review. Results This review showed that individuals who are born in cold season (winter month) have higher body mass index (BMI) and weight in childhood. Birth in March was associated with lower weight and BMI in boys according to most studies. All studies, except one of them, showed that season/month of birth was not associated with birth weight. Conclusions This systematic review confirms a relationship between season and month of birth with birth weight and body size in childhood; however, the impact of confounding factors, for example, vitamin D status, should be considered in the underlying pathway of this association. Impact The results provide evidence for the effect of season and month of birth on body size in childhood. Our systematic review suggests that there is no pattern between birth weight and season/month of birth, and the occurrence of low birth weight was more frequent among infants who were born in summer than others. Further research should focus on identifying the impact of confounding factors, for example, vitamin D status in the underlying pathway of this association. There was response to the controversial findings about the effect of environment factors, such as season and month of birth, and future anthropometric indices, such as obesity, weight, height, and birth weight. Obesity is a complex and multifactorial disorder; the findings of the current study would be useful in determining the relationship pathway between the season and the month of birth with other underlying factors for childhood obesity.",0
https://doi.org/10.1111/jonm.12895,Associations between work environment and implicit rationing of nursing care: A systematic review,"Aim To systematically evaluate the effect of working environment on implicit rationing of nursing care. Background Research has established direct and indirect associations between work environment and adverse patient outcomes. However, the causal nature of this relationship is uncertain, and implicit rationing has been proposed as a mediating factor between the work environment and patient outcomes. Method Eight databases were searched for articles published between May 2000 and May 2019. Results The reviewed articles provided evidence for the negative correlation between working environment and implicit rationing in 15 studies, and one of the studies showed that the correlation was not strong. There were differences in the levels of implicit rationing in different hospitals, units and shifts. Conclusion The degree of influence of various factors in the working environment on implicit rationing is different. In addition, the working environment is only one of the factors that affects implicit rationing. Implications for nursing management Nursing managers initiatives to improve nurses' work environments should include improve nurses' perception of the adequacy of staffing and resources and improving teamwork to decrease nursing care left undone, so as to improve nurse outcomes and quality of care.",0
https://doi.org/10.3390/jcm9041025,Use of Virtual Reality for the Management of Anxiety and Pain in Dental Treatments: Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis,"Background: Dental treatments often cause pain and anxiety in patients. Virtual reality (VR) is a novel procedure that can provide distraction during dental procedures or prepare patients to receive such type of treatments. This meta-analysis is the first to gather evidence on the effectiveness of VR on the reduction of pain (P) and dental anxiety (DA) in patients undergoing dental treatment, regardless of age. Methods: MEDLINE, CENTRAL, PubMed, EMBASE, Wiley Library and Web of Science were searched for scientific articles in November 2019. The keywords used were: “virtual reality”, “distraction systems”, “dental anxiety” and “pain”. Studies where VR was used for children and adults as a measure against anxiety and pain during dental treatments were included. VR was defined as a three-dimensional environment that provides patients with a sense of immersion, transporting them to appealing and interactive settings. Anxiety and pain results were assessed during dental treatments where VR was used, and in standard care situations. Results: 31 studies were identified, of which 14 met the inclusion criteria. Pain levels were evaluated in four studies (n = 4), anxiety levels in three (n = 3) and anxiety and pain together in seven (n = 7). Our meta-analysis was based on ten studies (n = 10). The effect of VR was studied mainly in the pediatric population (for pain SMD = −0.82). In the adult population, only two studies (not significant) were considered. Conclusions: The findings of the meta-analysis show that VR is an effective distraction method to reduce pain and anxiety in patients undergoing a variety of dental treatments; however, further research on VR as a tool to prepare patients for dental treatment is required because of the scarcity of studies in this area.",0
https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pntd.0008164,Occupational exposure to Brucella spp.: A systematic review and meta-analysis,"Brucellosis is a neglected zoonotic disease of remarkable importance worldwide. The focus of this systematic review was to investigate occupational brucellosis and to identify the main infection risks for each group exposed to the pathogen. Seven databases were used to identify papers related to occupational brucellosis: CABI, Cochrane, Pubmed, Scielo, Science Direct, Scopus and Web of Science. The search resulted in 6123 studies, of which 63 were selected using the quality assessment tools guided from National Institutes of Health (NIH) and Case Report Guidelines (CARE). Five different job-related groups were considered greatly exposed to the disease: rural workers, abattoir workers, veterinarians and veterinary assistants, laboratory workers and hunters. The main risk factors and exposure sources involved in the occupational infection observed from the analysis of the articles were direct contact with animal fluids, failure to comply with the use of personal protective equipment, accidental exposure to live attenuated anti-brucellosis vaccines and non-compliance with biosafety standards. Brucella species frequently isolated from job-related infection were Brucella melitensis, Brucella abortus, Brucella suis and Brucella canis. In addition, a meta-analysis was performed using the case-control studies and demonstrated that animal breeders, laboratory workers and abattoir workers have 3.47 [95% confidence interval (CI); 1.47-8.19] times more chance to become infected with Brucella spp. than others individuals that have no contact with the possible sources of infection. This systematic review improved the understanding of the epidemiology of brucellosis as an occupational disease. Rural workers, abattoir workers, veterinarians, laboratory workers and hunters were the groups more exposed to occupational Brucella spp. infection. Moreover, it was observed that the lack of knowledge about brucellosis among frequently exposed professionals, in addition to some behaviors, such as negligence in the use of individual and collective protective measures, increases the probability of infection.",0

The objective of this review study is to investigate the reported factors affecting the adoption of cloud in the health sector by comparing studies in the health and non-health sectors. This article is a systematized review of studies conducted in 2018. From 541 articles, 47 final articles were selected and classified into two categories: health and non-health studies; conclusions were drawn from the two sectors by comparing their effective factors. Based on the results of this review, the factors were categorized as technological, organizational, environmental, and individual. The results of this review study could be a beneficial guide to the health empirical research on cloud adoption. Individual domains have not been examined in health sector studies. Since the process of adoption of new technologies in organizations is time-consuming, due to the lack of managerial knowledge about the efficient factors, recognition of these factors by decision-makers while planning for cloud adoption becomes of great importance. The findings of this review study aim to help health decision-makers by increasing their awareness of the cloud and of the factors that impact decisions at both the organizational and individual levels.",0

Method We searched 18 electronic databases to identify English articles (published January 2000–December 2019) reporting on well‐defined DAIs targeting older adults (≥65 years) in RLTCF. Data were extracted by two independent reviewers. Descriptive statistics were produced for quantitative studies, with key themes identified among qualitative studies. Where possible, estimates were pooled from randomised controlled trials using random effects meta‐analyses.  Results Forty‐three relevant studies (39 quantitative; 4 qualitative) were identified. The majority of quantitative studies were assessed as low‐quality according to the MMAT criteria (n = 26, 67%). Almost half of the quantitative studies (n = 18, 46%) found no significant changes over time or between groups across outcomes measured. The most salient intervention effects included improved social functioning (n = 10), reduced depressive symptoms (n = 6) and loneliness (n = 5). A random‐effects meta‐analysis revealed a medium effect in favour of DAT on reducing depressive or loneliness symptoms (pooled SMD: 0.66, 95%CI 0.21–1.11; I2 = 50.5; five trials), relative to treatment as usual. However, compared to treatment as usual, no overall effect of DAI on activities of daily living was detected (p = .737). Key themes from qualitative studies included (a) animals as effective transitional objects, (b) the therapeutic value of pets and (c) the significance of the care environment and stakeholders in facilitating DAI.  Implications for practice The findings of this review indicate that while DAI has value for older people in RLTCF, challenges remain in accurately measuring its impact to provide a stronger evidence‐base. Standardisation of DAI service design, delivery and evaluation is required for future research and practice in providing holistic care for older adults.",0

Current guidelines recommend induction and maintenance of intravesical bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG) or upfront radical cystectomy for highest-risk disease, treatments with markedly different morbidity, mortality, and patient burden. There are no validated biomarkers to facilitate such treatment decisions. Alterations in DNA methylation are commonplace in BC; hence, measurable changes in DNA methylation represent an opportunity for the discovery of such biomarkers. <h3>Objective</h3> To systematically assess the evidence regarding DNA methylation markers as prognosticators for HR-NMIBC. <h3>Evidence acquisition</h3> Standard systematic review methods were employed with searches undertaken in MEDLINE, EMBASE, and PubMed up to January 2019. Studies that included patients with HR-NMIBC and investigated the utility of DNA methylation biomarkers as prognostic tools were included. <h3>Evidence synthesis</h3> Of 63 prognostic biomarker studies identified, 21 met the protocol-driven inclusion criteria and were directly relevant to HR-NMIBC patient outcomes: tumour recurrence (TR), tumour progression (TP), disease-specific survival (DSS), and overall survival (OS). These studies described 140 methylation markers; of these, the most promising were cadherin-13 (<i>CDH13</i>; hazard ratios [HRs]: 5.1 for TR, 6.6 for TP, 3.8–8.0 for OS), protocadherins (<i>PCDHs</i>; HRs: 4.7 for TR, 2.5 for TP, 3.0–4.8 for OS), Runt domain transcription factor 3 (<i>RUNX3</i>; HR: 5.1 for TP), Homeobox 9 (<i>HOXA9</i>; HR: 1.9 for TR), <i>Islet-1</i> (<i>ISL1</i>; HRs: 1.7 for TR, 3.3 for TP), and <i>PAX6</i> (HR: 2.2 for TR). <h3>Conclusions</h3> This systematic review identifies a number of potentially useful prognostic methylation markers for HR-NMIBC. These loci (<i>CDH13</i>, <i>PCDH</i>s, <i>RUNX3</i>, <i>HOXA9</i>, <i>ISL1</i>, and <i>PAX6</i>) should be validated in prospective studies in order to translate benefit to patients. <h3>Patient summary</h3> Early bladder cancer represents a more complex spectrum of disease than can be assessed by conventional methods Emerging studies on molecular markers will improve our understanding of this disease, and may enable more precise and personalised treatment.",0
https://doi.org/10.1186/s12888-020-02593-1,The usefulness of pre-employment and pre-deployment psychological screening for disaster relief workers: a systematic review,"Abstract Background Individuals who conduct disaster relief work overseas are exposed to a variety of traumatic events that can cause distress and trigger psychological illnesses. Identification of which disaster relief workers may be at risk of experiencing psychological distress or mental health disorders is frequently carried out through pre-employment or pre-deployment psychological screening. The primary objective of our review was to assess the evidence for pre-employment and pre-deployment psychological screening of relief workers who work in disaster situations. We aimed to identify specific pre-employment and pre-deployment characteristics that predict impaired wellbeing of an individual following engaging in disaster-related work. Methods A combined list of search terms was composed relating to disaster-related occupations, screening methods, psychological disorders, and study design. The databases used were PsycINFO, MEDLINE, EMBASE, and GlobalHealth. We included studies that used cross-sectional or longitudinal study designs; were published in the English language in peer-reviewed academic journals; reported on the association between pre-employment and pre-deployment features and post-deployment psychological disorders or distress; considered any occupational groups responding to a specified, discrete crisis; and used at least one validated measure of distress or disorder. We extracted data on the author; year of publication; disaster description; country of study; study design; population sample; disorder(s) outcome and the measures used; and results. Results Sixty-two, high-quality studies were included in the review. Forty-one potential predictors were identified. Of these, only volunteer status and previous history of mental illness and life stressors emerged as reliable predictors of distress or disorder. Conclusion The results suggest that whilst it is attractive to screen for pre-employment and pre-deployment indicators of resilience, the evidence base for doing so is weak. At best, this sort of screening can only weakly suggest vulnerability and at worst may result in discrimination. Until better evidence about its usefulness becomes available, employers should exercise caution over its use.",0
https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jen.2020.02.011,Salt Toxicity: A Systematic Review and Case Reports,"<h2>Abstract</h2><h3>Introduction</h3> Salt toxicity is a rare form of hypernatremia that typically occurs after a single massive ingestion of salt over a short period of time (minutes/hours). It is a dangerous imbalance capable of causing significant neurological injury; quick recognition of salt toxicity is crucial to allow treatment before permanent brain injury occurs. The purpose of this review is to assist emergency nurses in gaining knowledge on the causes, pathophysiology, symptoms, and treatment of salt toxicity. <h3>Methods</h3> A systematic search for case reports of hypernatremia due to salt toxicity was conducted in the PubMed and Scopus electronic databases. The search terms used were <i>salt, sodium, hypernatremia, toxicity, poisoning, case reports, case series,</i> and <i>cases.</i> The following were the inclusion criteria: publication dates between January 1, 2000, and September 30, 2019; evidence of an acute large oral or gastric tube ingestion of salt over a short period of time (minutes/hours); admission for treatment within hours of the event; laboratory verification of hypernatremia; and full-text article available electronically in English. The following were the exclusion criteria: an unclear history, high salt consumption over a period of days, high sodium intake via the intravenous route, and breast feeding. <h3>Results</h3> Only 15 cases met the inclusion criteria for the review. Patients described in the case reports ranged in age from 5 days to 73 years. Forty percent of the patients were children less than 15 years old. Of the 14 cases with known outcomes, 50% were fatal. The most frequent causes of salt toxicity were salt water emetics, intentional administration of large quantities of salt to a child by a caregiver, and suicide attempts. Among the other causes were unintentional salt overload in infant formula, an exorcism ritual, and a college prank. <h3>Discussion</h3> Findings from this review of 15 case reports in which a large salt load was ingested over a short period of time suggest that salt toxicity is a rare condition associated with high mortality. In addition, salt toxicity can occur in patients of all ages for a variety of reasons; the most frequently identified reasons in this review were use of salt water as an emetic and child abuse by the intentional administration of a high salt load by a caregiver. For patients whose massive exposure to salt is recent (such as minutes to hours), rapidly reducing the serum sodium concentration may prevent irreversible neurological injury.",0
https://doi.org/10.1080/0284186x.2020.1747636,BRAF mutational status as a prognostic marker for survival in malignant melanoma: a systematic review and meta-analysis,"Background: The analysis of the BRAF mutational status has been established as a standard procedure during diagnosis of advanced malignant melanoma due to the fact that BRAF inhibitors constitute a cornerstone in the treatment of metastatic disease. However, the general impact of BRAF mutational status on survival remains unclear. Our study aimed to assess the underlying prognostic significance of BRAF mutant versus wild type (WT) malignant melanoma on overall survival (OS), disease-free survival (DFS) and progression-free survival (PFS).Material and methods: A systematic literature search in EMBASE, Medline and Cochrane CENTRAL was performed. Studies were included if they reported survival outcomes for BRAF mutant versus WT patients as hazard ratios (HR) or in Kaplan-Meier (KM) curves. Random-effects meta-analysis models were used to pool HRs across the studies.Results: Data from 52 studies, representing 7519 patients, were pooled for analysis of OS. The presence of a BRAF mutation was statistically significantly associated with a reduced OS (HR [95% confidence interval (CI)]: 1.23 [1.09-1.38]), however, with substantial heterogeneity between the studies (I2: 58.0%). Meta-regression and sensitivity analyses showed that age, sex and BRAF mutation testing method did not have a significant effect on the OS HR. BRAF mutant melanoma showed comparable effect on DFS to non-BRAF mutant melanoma in stage I-III melanoma (combined HR: 1.16, 95% CI: 0.92-1.46), and on PFS in stage III-IV (HR: 0.98 (95% CI: 0.68-1.40)).Conclusion: Although there was substantial heterogeneity between the studies, the overall results demonstrated a poorer prognosis and OS in patients harbouring BRAF mutations. Future studies should take this into account when evaluating epidemiological data and treatment effects of new interventions in patients with malignant melanoma.",0
https://doi.org/10.1177/1524838019835973,Child Abuse in Natural Disasters and Conflicts: A Systematic Review,"Violence against children affects a significant portion of youth around the world. Emergencies and natural disasters escalate the risk due to weakened child protection systems and disruption of preventative mechanisms. In this systematic review, 692 related papers were searched in various databases in the initial search. After review, 11 papers were finally selected for full review. These papers were selected based on publication date, relevance to emergencies, their geographical area type of violence, age of subjects, and their gender. Most families affected by natural disasters, especially those in lower socioeconomic status, face greater social and economic pressures. The families that are more vulnerable to loss of food and shelter commit violence against children more frequently. On the other hand, while the rate of violence increases in emergencies, the reported rate of violence is less than the actual rate due to lack of required infrastructure and reporting mechanisms. The emergency housing increased risk of some types of child abuse. The history of exposure to violence, parental substance abuse, poverty, and child labor were predictors of increased violence against children in emergency situations. Sexual violence against girls after conflicts and physical violence against boys after emergencies are common forms of violence. Poverty as another predictor exposes children to more violence due to limited family economic resources and support. Given the identified predictors of violence, humanitarian organizations can come closer to providing appropriate plans to reduce the risk during and postdisaster.",0
https://doi.org/10.1177/0194599820906387,Impact of Time to Diagnosis and Treatment in Head and Neck Cancer: A Systematic Review,"Objective An increased interval between symptomatic disease and treatment may negatively influence oncologic and/or functional outcomes in head and neck cancer (HNC). This systematic review aims to provide insight into the effects of time to treatment intervals on oncologic and functional outcomes in oral cavity, pharyngeal, and laryngeal cancer. Data Sources PubMed, EMBASE, and Cochrane library were searched. Review Methods All studies on delay or time to diagnosis or treatment in oral, pharyngeal, and laryngeal cancer were included. Quality assessment was performed with an adjusted version of the Newcastle-Ottawa scale. Outcomes of interest were tumor volume, stage, recurrence, survival, patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs), toxicity, and functionality after treatment. Results A total of 51 studies were included. Current literature on the influence of delay in HNC is inconsistent but indicates higher stage and worse survival with longer delay. The effects on PROMs, toxicity, and functional outcome after treatment have not been investigated. The inconsistencies in outcomes were most likely caused by factors such as heterogeneity in study design, differences in the definitions of delay, bias of results, and incomplete adjustment for confounding factors in the included studies. Conclusion Irrespective of the level of evidence, the unfavorable effects of delay on oncologic, functional, and psychosocial outcomes are undisputed. Timely treatment while maintaining high-quality diagnostic procedures and decision making reflects good clinical practice in our opinion. This review will pose practical and logistic challenges that will have to be overcome.",0

The aim of this study was to evaluate the prevalence rate of DM and HTN following natural and man-made disasters that impose significant economic and psychological burdens on human communities.METHODS: In this systematic and meta-analysis review, all crosssectional studies that at least one of their objectives was to measure the prevalence of HTN or DM in individuals affected by natural and man-made disasters were included. Literature review was done in international databases including PubMed, Scopus and Web of Science, from database inception to February 17, 2019. The extracted data included the bibliographic characteristics of the article, the age of the participants, number of participants, gender, sample size, outcome, duration of the follow-up, and prevalence of DM and HTN. Data were analyzed by STATA software (version11) and random effect method and the I2 index were used to investigate heterogeneity between the articles.RESULTS: A total of 16 articles met the inclusion criteria. Based on the quality assessment, 11 papers were categorized as moderate and 5 paper were categorized as high quality. The prevalence of HTN and DM in disaster-exposed populations were 47.35 (CI 95%: 38.53-56.17) and 13.56 (CI 95%: 10.12-17.01), respectively.CONCLUSION: The results of this study show a high prevalence of HTN and DM in survivors of major disasters, which is higher in comparison to the general population.",0

A search in Medline and Embase identified 51 articles reporting association of spontaneous abortion (SA), preterm delivery (PTD) or small-for-gestational-age (SGA) infant with exposure to occupational lifting. A global validity score was assigned to each study and six potential sources of bias were considered in sensitivity analyses. For each exposure–outcome combination, a summary risk estimate (RE) was obtained from all studies and from a subset of studies with high validity score, this latter summary RE was selected as a final result. Statistical heterogeneity was measured with I 2 and Q tests and the possibility of a publication bias was also assessed. For each meta-analysis, the strength of evidence was established from explicit criteria. Heavy (or ≥10 kg) loads often (or ≥10x/day) lifted were associated with increased risks of SA (summary RE=1.31, 95% CI 1.17 to 1.47) and PTD (summary RE=1.24, 95% CI 1.07 to 1.43), with good strength of evidence. No association was identified with SGA, nor with lower exposure levels and SA or PTD. These results are reassuring for lower levels of exposure; however, observed associations can guide health professionals’ recommendations aimed at the prevention of SA and PTD for pregnant women who frequently lift (or ≥10x/day) heavy (or ≥10 kg) loads at work.

Following this earthquake, rehabilitation was greatly required for survivors to enable them to achieve and maintain optimal independence; functioning; full physical, mental and social ability; inclusion; and participation in all aspects of life and environments. We conducted a systematic review based on Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines to retrospectively identify, in five English databases/sources, the existing evidence about the Health-Related Rehabilitation (HRR) that was rendered to the survivors of the 2008 Wenchuan earthquake between 2008 and 2018. Only 11 studies out of 828 initial studies retrieved were included in our study and reported the survivors of the 2008 Wenchuan earthquake to have been aged between 10.5 and 55.7, and predominantly diagnosed with posttraumatic stress disorders. Their HRR was mainly premised on physical and physiological therapies, as well as traditional Chinese medicine and digital technologies. Although all HRR interventions used were reported to be effective, none was identified as much more effective than the others in the post-earthquake era —which calls for more robust research to build upon our systematic review.",0
https://doi.org/10.1111/bdi.12904,Functioning in euthymic patients with bipolar disorder: A systematic review and meta‐analysis using the Functioning Assessment Short Test,"Objectives Systematically review the prevalence of functional impairment (FI) in euthymic patients with bipolar disorder (BD), as assessed only with the Functioning Assessment Short Test (FAST), explore the prevalence of this impairment among all the domains, identify the most compromised of them and the clinical variables associated with low functioning in this population. Methods Meta-analyses were performed, searching for relevant papers published from 2007 to 2019 in Medline, Embase, Cochrane, PsycINFO databases and via hand-searching, without language restrictions. 1128 studies were initially identified, 13 of which were ultimately chosen based on the eligibility criteria. A two-step meta-analysis was performed using the mean difference with a 95% confidence interval for continuous variables and proportion estimation with a fixed-effects model for categorical variables. Results In the first step, all FAST domains showed worse FI in patients than in healthy controls, with significant differences between groups. In the second step, the prevalence of FI domains were as follows: global, 58.6%; occupational, 65.6%; cognitive, 49.2%; autonomy, 42.6%; interpersonal relationships, 42.1%; leisure, 29.2%; and financial issues, 28.8%. Residual depressive symptoms were the most frequently cited variable associated with FI. Conclusions This study reinforces the relevant functional impact of BD in this population and suggests that the occupational domain may be the most impaired. Greater efforts should be directed toward targeting functioning in patient care, as it constitutes the most meaningful endpoint of response to treatment, especially with occupational and cognitive rehabilitation, thus allowing patients to overcome the course of illness and carry fulfilling lives.",0

According to recent studies, the associations between PBDEs and rodent male reproductive system are controversial. Therefore, we performed this systematic review and meta-analysis to clarify the effects of PBDEs on rodent male reproductive system. Data were extracted from articles collected from PubMed, Web of Science, and other databases. The pooled standard mean deviation (SMD) with 95% confidence interval (95% CI) was used to evaluate the association between the male rodent reproductive system impairment and PBDE exposure. Ten articles were included in the present meta-analysis and systematic review. The summary SMD of reproductive toxicity associated with PBDEs was -0.46 (95% CI: -0.69, -0.22), and the overall association between DE-71 along with BDE-209 and male reproductive system damage was statistically significant (SMD = -0.7 95% CI: -1.18, -0.21, p = .041; SMD = -0.41, 95% CI: -0.77, -0.05, p = .000). The adverse impact of PBDEs on rodent male reproductive system, especially seminal vesicle (SMD = -1.09, 95% CI: -1.49, -0.49, p = .523) and ventral prostate (SMD = -1.27, 95% CI: -1.88, -0.65, p = .821), were clearly demonstrated. Moderate (SMD = -0.81, 95% CI: -1.182, -0.437, p = .197) and high (SMD = -0.41, 95% CI: -0.76, -0.05, p = .000) dosage may have exerted effect than relatively low (SMD = -0.29, 95% CI: -0.17, 0.12, p = .136) dosage.

https://doi.org/10.1111/1754-9485.13036,Particle therapy toxicity outcomes: A systematic review,"Owing to its physical properties, particle therapy (PT), including proton beam therapy (PBT) and carbon ion therapy (CIT), can enhance the therapeutic ratio in radiation therapy. The major factor driving PT implementation is the reduction in exit and integral dose compared to photon plans, which is expected to translate to reduced toxicity and improved quality of life. This study extends the findings from a recent systematic review by the current authors which concentrated on tumour outcomes for PT, to now examine toxicity as a separate focus. Together, these reviews provide a comprehensive collation of the evidence relating to PT outcomes in clinical practice. Three major databases were searched by two independent researchers, and evidence quality was classified according to the National Health and Medical Research Council evidence hierarchy. One hundred and seventy-nine studies were included. Most demonstrated acceptable and favourable toxicity results. Comparative evidence reported reduced morbidities and improvement in quality of life in head and neck, paediatrics, sarcomas, adult central nervous system, gastrointestinal, ocular and prostate cancers compared to photon radiotherapy. This suggestion for reduced morbidity must be counterbalanced by the overall low quality of evidence. A concerted effort in the design of appropriate comparative clinical trials is needed which takes into account integration of PT’s pace of technological advancements, including evolving delivery techniques, image guidance availability and sophistication of planning algorithms.",0

To date, coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) has spread to over 200 countries, leading to over 1.6 million cases and over 99,000 deaths. Given that there is neither a vaccine nor proven treatment for COVID-19, there is currently an urgent need for effective pharmacotherapy. To address the need for an effective treatment of SARS-CoV-2 during the worldwide pandemic, this systematic review of intravenous (IV) remdesivir was performed. Remdesivir, an anti-viral prodrug originally developed to treat Ebola virus disease, has shown broad spectrum activity against the Coronavirus family. A recent case report reported improvement of clinical symptoms with remdesivir in a patient with COVID-19. After conducting a systematic search of 18 clinical trial registries and three large scientific databases, we identified 86 potentially eligible items. Following removal of duplicates (n = 21), eligible studies were reviewed independently by two authors. After the first round of screening, inter-rater agreement was 98.5% (κ = 0.925). After the second round of full-text screening, inter-rater agreement was 100%. A total of seven ongoing and recruiting clinical trials of remdesivir (100-200 milligrams, intravenous [IV]) were included. We identified the following primary outcomes: patients discharged (n = 2); time to clinical status improvement (n = 2); improved O2 saturation (n = 2); body temperature normalization (n = 2); and clinical status (n = 1). Secondary outcomes in all identified studies included documentation of adverse events. Phase 3 trials are expected to be completed between April 2020–2023. Therefore, despite supportive data from in vitro and in vivo studies, the clinical effectiveness of IV remdesivir for treatment of COVID-19 and potential side effects remain incompletely defined in the human population.",0

One subgroup that may be at particularly high risk of developing obesity is the offspring of parents who have undergone weight loss surgery (PWLS). To date, little research has focused on these offspring or their parents. This systematic review addresses this gap by integrating available literature and assessing the quality of the evidence. To be included, studies were required to have researched characteristics of the offspring of PWLS or parental feeding practices within this population. After review, 12 studies met inclusion criteria. Findings include evidence for heightened risk of obesity among children of PWLS. However, research suggests these children may experience positive, although time-limited, health outcomes after their parents' surgeries. Quality of the evidence was rated as low, primarily because of the lack of randomized controlled studies and information regarding available interventions specifically targeting this vulnerable population. This review underscores the need for research to improve understanding of PWLS families to better support them and capitalize on postbariatric surgery benefits.",0

To review existing literature on causative agents of DILI in the East compared to the West, a comprehensive literature search was performed on electronic databases: MEDLINE/PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library and China National Knowledge Infrastructure without language restrictions. Studies which involve patients having DILI and reported the frequency of causative agents were included. A random effects model was applied to synthesize the current evidence using prevalence of class-specific and agent-specific causative drugs with 95% confidence intervals. Of 6,914 articles found, 12 showed the distribution of drugs implicated in DILI in the East with a total of 33,294 patients and 16 in the West with a total of 26,069 DILI cases. In the East, the most common agents by class were anti-tuberculosis drugs (26.6%), herbal and alternative medications (25.3%), and antibiotics (15.7%), while in the West, antibiotics (34.9%), cardiovascular agents (17.3%), and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (12.5%) were the commonest.

However, the extent to which performance across domain-specific subskills in reading and mathematics is associated with preterm birth remains unclear. <h3>Objective</h3> To conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis of academic outcomes of school-aged children born preterm, compared with children born at term, appraising evidence for higher- and lower-order subskills in reading and mathematics. <h3>Data Sources</h3> PubMed/MEDLINE, PsycINFO, and the Cumulative Index of Nursing and Allied Health Literature electronic databases from January 1, 1980, to July 30, 2018, were searched for population, exposure, and outcome terms such as<i>child</i>(population),<i>preterm birth</i>(exposure), and<i>education*</i>(outcome). <h3>Study Selection</h3> Peer-reviewed English-language publications that included preterm-born children and a comparison group of term-born children aged 5 to 18 years and born during or after 1980 and that reported outcomes on standardized assessments from cohort or cross-sectional studies were screened. Of the 9833 articles screened, 33 unique studies met the inclusion criteria. <h3>Data Extraction and Synthesis</h3> Data were analyzed from August 1 to September 29, 2018. The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses (PRISMA) guidelines were followed. Two reviewers independently screened the databases and extracted sample characteristics and outcomes scores. Pooled mean differences (MDs) were analyzed using random-effects models. <h3>Main Outcomes and Measures</h3> Performance on standardized assessment of higher-order subskills of reading comprehension and applied mathematics problems; lower-order reading subskills of decoding, pseudoword decoding, and word identification; and lower-order mathematics subskills of knowledge, calculation, and fluency. <h3>Results</h3> Outcomes data were extracted for 4006 preterm and 3317 term-born children, totaling 7323 participants from 33 unique studies. Relative to children born at term, children born preterm scored significantly lower in reading comprehension (mean difference [MD], −7.96; 95% CI, −12.15 to −3.76;<i>I</i><sup>2</sup> = 81%) and applied mathematical problems (MD, −11.41; 95% CI, −17.57 to −5.26;<i>I</i><sup>2</sup> = 91%) assessments. Across the assessments of lower-order skills, children born preterm scored significantly lower than their term-born peers in calculation (MD, −10.57; 95% CI, −15.62 to −5.52;<i>I</i><sup>2</sup> = 92%), decoding (MD, −10.18; 95% CI, −16.83 to −3.53;<i>I</i><sup>2</sup> = 71%), mathematical knowledge (MD, −9.88; 95% CI, −11.68 to −8.08;<i>I</i><sup>2</sup> = 62%), word identification (MD, −7.44; 95% CI, −9.08 to −5.80;<i>I</i><sup>2</sup> = 69%), and mathematical fluency (MD, −6.89; 95% CI, −13.54 to −0.23;<i>I</i><sup>2</sup> = 72%). The associations remained unchanged after sensitivity analyses for reducing heterogeneity. <h3>Conclusions and Relevance</h3> These findings provide evidence that preterm birth is associated with academic underperformance in aggregate measures of reading and mathematics, as well as a variety of related subskills.",0

Left untreated, PTSD can have far-reaching and damaging consequences for the individual, families, communities, and society at large. Although early detection and intervention are recognized as key to the effective treatment of PTSD, many individuals who suffer from PTSD do not seek essential health services. The aim of the present study was to identify the barriers and facilitators to help-seeking for individuals with PTSD, based on existing literature. A systematic review, modeled on the Joanna Briggs Institute methodology for systematic reviews, examined studies cited in PsycINFO, Medline, Embase, CINAHL, and PILOTS published from January 1980 to January 2019. Eligible studies measured barriers and facilitators to help-seeking for adults with PTSD. Two reviewers independently screened citations, and double data extraction was exercised. Of 2,391 potentially relevant citations, 21 studies, published between 1989 and 2018 and based in six countries, were included. Seventeen studies focused on military as a target population. We identified 10 principal barrier and facilitator themes: trauma-related; treatment; therapist or provider; knowledge; access; health care system; sociocultural environment; values, beliefs, and priorities; past experiences; and medical care needs and illness burden. In identifying prominent barriers and facilitators to help-seeking for individuals with PTSD, this review highlights opportunities to inform policies and programs that promote PTSD knowledge and recognition, reduce public and personal stigma, improve access and quality of care, and encourage support for patients and families living with PTSD.",0

The benefit of standalone intrathecal prophylaxis in reducing CNS recurrence is unclear and remains controversial. No systematic review analysing the evidence for stand-alone intrathecal prophylaxis has been performed in the era of anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody therapy. A comprehensive search (01/2002-01/2019) was systematically performed using Ovid MEDLINE®, Ovid EMBASE® and Cochrane. Studies were selected from a total of 804, screened based on predefined inclusion/exclusion criteria, and were critically appraised. Three post hoc analyses (RICOVER-60, RCHOP-14/21, GOYA), one prospective database and 10 retrospective series were included. 7,357 rituximab/obinutuzumab-exposed patients were analysed. The median percentage receiving intrathecal prophylaxis was 11.9%. Cumulative CNS relapse incidence ranged from 1.9% at 6.5 years to 8.4% at 5 years. Median time (of medians) to CNS relapse was 10 months. 73% developed isolated CNS relapses, 24% concurrent CNS/systemic relapse, and 3% post-systemic relapse. Reported CNS relapse sites were: parenchymal (58%), leptomeningeal (27%), and both (12%). Event rates were low resulting in limited power within each study to provide robust univariable/multivariable analysis. Intrathecal prophylaxis was not a univariable or multivariable factor associated with a reduction in CNS relapse in any study. We found no strong evidence for the benefit, or indeed genuine lack of benefit, of stand-alone intrathecal prophylaxis in preventing CNS relapse in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma-treated patients using anthracycline-based immunochemotherapy. Current published study designs limit the strength of such conclusions.",0

Components of one-carbon (1C) metabolism, which are required for nucleotide synthesis and methylation reactions, may be related to risk of RCC but existing evidence is inconclusive. We conducted a systematic review and independent exposure-specific meta-analyses of dietary intake and circulating biomarkers of 1C metabolites and RCC risk. Methods Medline and Embase databases were searched for observational studies investigating RCC or kidney cancer incidence or mortality in relation to components of 1C metabolism and 12 eligible articles were included in the meta-analyses. We used Bayesian meta-analyses to estimate summary relative risks (RRs) and 95% credible intervals (CrIs) comparing the highest versus lowest categories as well as the between-study heterogeneity. Results We did not find convincing evidence of an association between any exposure (riboflavin, vitamin B 6 , folate, vitamin B 12 , methionine, homocysteine, choline, or betaine) and RCC risk. However, vitamin B 6 biomarker status did have a protective (RR = 0.62) but imprecise (95% CrI 0.39–1.14) effect estimate and folate intake had a notable association as well (RR = 0.85, 95% CrI 0.71–1.01). Conclusion There was a lack of precision due largely to the low number of studies. Further investigation is warranted, especially for folate and vitamin B 6 , which had consistent suggestive evidence of a protective effect for both dietary intake and biomarker status. A unique strength of this review is the use of Bayesian meta-analyses which allowed for robust estimation of between-study heterogeneity.",0

A systematic review,"Abstract Background There is extensive lack of awareness of maternal mental health and its impact on child development in low- and middle-income countries (LAMICs). The aim of this systematic review was to analyze evidence for various maternal perinatal mental health disorders and their association with different domains of infant and toddler neurodevelopment during the first two postnatal years in LAMICs. Methods A comprehensive literature search was conducted within six databases from Jan 1990–April 2019. All included studies were narratively synthesized. Results Twenty-four studies, nine cross sectional and 15 longitudinal cohort studies, were included. Three studies were conducted in low-income, 11 in lower-middle-income and ten in upper-middle-income countries. The majority of studies assessed maternal mental health postnatally and 14 of these 22 studies found a significant association with infant and toddler neurodevelopment. Five of the ten studies reporting on exposure to prenatal mental health found a significant association. The most common maternal mental health disorder studied was depression, while the main neurodevelopmental outcomes assessed were motor, cognitive and language development. Limitations Meta-analysis could not be conducted due to the variability in the reported maternal mental health disorders and the different times of assessment of exposures and outcomes. Conclusions Maternal perinatal mental health disorders and their association with different domains of neurodevelopment in LAMICs is still inconclusive due to a limited number of papers. Mother-infant dyads in LAMICs are exposed to multiple and cumulative risk factors and causal pathways between maternal mental health and infant neurodevelopment are still poorly understood.",0
https://doi.org/10.1186/s12940-020-00601-1,Systematic review and meta-analysis of case-crossover and time-series studies of short term outdoor nitrogen dioxide exposure and ischemic heart disease morbidity,"Abstract Background Nitrogen dioxide (NO 2 ) is a pervasive urban pollutant originating primarily from vehicle emissions. Ischemic heart disease (IHD) is associated with a considerable public health burden worldwide, but whether NO 2 exposure is causally related to IHD morbidity remains in question. Our objective was to determine whether short term exposure to outdoor NO 2 is causally associated with IHD-related morbidity based on a synthesis of findings from case-crossover and time-series studies. Methods MEDLINE, Embase, CENTRAL, Global Health and Toxline databases were searched using terms developed by a librarian. Screening, data extraction and risk of bias assessment were completed independently by two reviewers. Conflicts between reviewers were resolved through consensus and/or involvement of a third reviewer. Pooling of results across studies was conducted using random effects models, heterogeneity among included studies was assessed using Cochran’s Q and I 2 measures, and sources of heterogeneity were evaluated using meta-regression. Sensitivity of pooled estimates to individual studies was examined using Leave One Out analysis and publication bias was evaluated using Funnel plots, Begg’s and Egger’s tests, and trim and fill. Results Thirty-eight case-crossover studies and 48 time-series studies were included in our analysis. NO 2 was significantly associated with IHD morbidity (pooled odds ratio from case-crossover studies: 1.074 95% CI 1.052–1.097; pooled relative risk from time-series studies: 1.022 95% CI 1.016–1.029 per 10 ppb). Pooled estimates for case-crossover studies from Europe and North America were significantly lower than for studies conducted elsewhere. The high degree of heterogeneity among studies was only partially accounted for in meta-regression. There was evidence of publication bias, particularly for case-crossover studies. For both case-crossover and time-series studies, pooled estimates based on multi-pollutant models were smaller than those from single pollutant models, and those based on older populations were larger than those based on younger populations, but these differences were not statistically significant. Conclusions We concluded that there is a likely causal relationship between short term NO 2 exposure and IHD-related morbidity, but important uncertainties remain, particularly related to the contribution of co-pollutants or other concomitant exposures, and the lack of supporting evidence from toxicological and controlled human studies.",1
https://doi.org/10.1007/s10067-019-04866-x,Incidence of tuberculosis in patients receiving anti-TNF therapy for rheumatic diseases: a systematic review,"The TNF inhibitors were the first immunobiologicals used to treat rheumatic diseases, but their use is associated with an increased risk of tuberculosis. The primary objective is to estimate the incidence of tuberculosis in patients with rheumatic diseases exposed to anti-TNF therapy. The secondary objectives are to evaluate the incidence of tuberculosis by region and subgroups of diseases, to review the presentation of tuberculosis in these patients, and to assess the time elapsed between onset of anti-TNF therapy and development of active granulomatous disease. A systematic review of the literature was conducted in MEDLINE, the Cochrane Library, and LILACS. The primary endpoint was described as incidence and secondary outcomes, through subgroup analyses and comparisons of means. We included 52 observational studies. Among the exposed patients, 947 cases of tuberculosis were documented (62.2% pulmonary), with a cumulative incidence of 9.62 cases per 1000 patients exposed. TB incidence across different continents was distributed as follows: South America, 11.75 cases/1000 patients exposed; North America, 4.34 cases/1000 patients exposed; Europe, 6.28 cases/1000 patients exposed; and Asia, 13.47 cases/1000 patients exposed. There were no significant differences in TB incidence among the described diseases. The mean time elapsed from start of anti-TNF therapy until the endpoint was 18.05 months. The incidence of TB in patients with rheumatic diseases exposed TNF inhibitor considering all countries was 9.62 cases per 1000 patients exposed. TB incidence was higher in South America and Asia compared with North America and Europe. Most cases occurred in the first XX months of use, and the pulmonary form predominated.",0
https://doi.org/10.1007/s40615-020-00700-2,A Systematic Review of Environmental Health Outcomes in Selected American Indian and Alaska Native Populations,"Economic and social marginalization among American Indians and Alaska Natives (AI/ANs) results in higher chronic disease prevalence. Potential causal associations between toxic environmental exposures and adverse health outcomes within AI/AN communities are not well understood. This review examines epidemiological literature on exposure to toxicants and associated adverse health outcomes among AI/AN populations. PubMed, Embase, Cochrane, Environment Complete, Web of Science Plus, DART, and ToxLine were searched for English-language articles. The following data were extracted: lead author’s last name, publication year, cohort name, study location, AI/AN tribe, study initiation and conclusion, sample size, primary characteristic, environmental exposure, health outcomes, risk estimates, and covariates. About 31 articles on three types of environmental exposures met inclusion criteria: persistent organic pollutants (POPs), heavy metals, and open dumpsites. Of these, 17 addressed exposure to POPs, 10 heavy metal exposure, 2 exposure to both POPs and heavy metals, and 2 exposure to open dumpsites. Studies on the Mohawk Nation at Akwesasne; Yupik on St. Lawrence Island, Alaska; Navajo Nation; Gila River Indian Community; Cheyenne River Sioux; 197 Alaska Native villages; and 13 tribes in Arizona, Oklahoma, North Dakota, and South Dakota that participated in the Strong Heart Study support associations between toxicant exposure and various chronic conditions including cardiovascular conditions, reproductive abnormalities, cancer, autoimmune disorders, neurological deficits, and diabetes. The complex interplay of environmental and social factors in disease etiology among AI/ANs is a product of externally imposed environmental exposures, systemic discrimination, and modifiable risk behaviors. The connection between environmental health disparities and adverse health outcomes indicates a need for further study.",0
https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijheh.2020.113546,Dose-related effect of secondhand smoke on cardiovascular disease in nonsmokers: Systematic review and meta-analysis,"Despite the positive association between secondhand smoke (SHS) and cardiovascular diseases (CVD), no comprehensive assessment on the dose-response relationship between SHS and CVD has yet been reported. Therefore, a meta-analysis was conducted to update the binary association, and to elucidate the dose-response relationship of both self-reported and objectively measured SHS exposure with CVD. PubMed and Embase databases were searched for articles published up to November 12, 2019. Random-effects models were used to assess the summary odds ratios (ORs) of CVD with SHS exposure. Restricted cubic splines were used to fit the dose-response relationship. Fifty-five eligible observational studies were included in this meta-analysis to investigate the association between SHS exposure and CVD. Based on the meta-analysis, the pooled OR of CVD was 1.22 (95% CI 1.17–1.28) for the self-reported SHS individuals as comparing to the non-exposed group. The result of restricted cubic splines showed a risk plateau of SHS exposure at 15 cigarettes per day ( P non-linearity = 0.042), while other characteristics s of SHS exposure (amount, daily and cumulative duration, and cotinine) were in linear relationships with CVD ( P non-linearity >0.05). In addition, an estimated of 6.77% (95% CI: 5.31%–8.46%) of all CVD cases in men and 7.15% (95% CI: 5.62%–8.93%) in women might be attributed to SHS exposure worldwide. Exposure to SHS is associated with an increased risk of CVD regardless of the modes. And thus, well-enforced smoke-free laws could possibly reduce a substantial risk of CVD caused by SHS. • Nonsmokers exposed to SHS had a 22% higher risk of cardiovascular diseases. • A risk plateau of CVD was observed on SHS exposure at 15 cigarettes per day. • The PAF of CVD for SHS exposure in Asia was much higher than that in America. • Any exposure to SHS was associated with increased cardiovascular disease risk.",1
https://doi.org/10.1093/jjco/hyaa007,Definitive radiation therapy in patients with unresectable desmoid tumors: a systematic review,"Abstract Background Desmoid tumors are rare soft tissue tumors. Wide local excision has been the standard surgical treatment for desmoid tumors. However, this procedure results in high local recurrence rates, so non-surgical treatments should be considered. The aim of this systematic review was to evaluate the effect of radiation therapy on patients with desmoid tumors, especially those with unresectable disease. Methods We evaluated studies published between 1 January 1990 and 31 August 2017 and cited in PubMed and Ichushi (in Japanese). All studies evaluating the effect of radiation therapy on desmoid tumors were included. Data regarding radiation dose, recurrence and adverse events were recorded. Results Among 218 identified studies, only 6 were finally included in this review. Local control was achieved in 253 of 317 patients with unresectable or unresected tumors who underwent definitive radiation therapy (the crude rate of local control was 79.8%). Toxicity was evaluated in patients who underwent definitive radiation therapy or surgery plus radiation therapy. One of the most common acute complications was skin toxicity. Frequent late complications of radiation therapy included fibrosis/contracture/joint stiffness, skin disorders, lymphedema and pain. Six patients developed secondary malignancies in the radiation field. Conclusions In patients treated unsuccessfully with surgery, watchful waiting and pharmacotherapy, radiation therapy may be an option as salvage therapy because of the high rate of local control. Because desmoid tumors frequently develop in young individuals, children and young patients who receive radiation therapy for the treatment of desmoid tumors should be followed up on a long-term basis with periodic monitoring for late radiation toxicities.",0

CRC screening is associated with significant reductions in CRC incidence and mortality, however, uptake is suboptimal. This systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials explored the effectiveness of interventions designed to increase screening uptake, plus the impact of various moderators. Data from 102 studies including 1.94 million participants were analysed. Results showed significant benefit of all interventions combined (OR, 1.49, 95% CI: 1.43, 1.56, p < 0.001). The effects were similar in studies using objective versus self-reported uptake measures and lower in studies judged to be at high risk of bias. Moderator analyses indicated significant effects for aspects of behaviour (effects lower for studies on non-endoscopic procedures), and intervention (effects higher for studies conducted in community settings, in healthcare systems that are not free, and that use reminders, health-professional providers, paper materials supplemented with in-person or phone contact, but avoid remote contact). Interventions that included behaviour change techniques targeting social support (unspecified or practical), instructions or demonstration of the behaviour, and that added objects to the environment produced stronger effects. The way in which findings can inform interventions to improve CRC screening uptake is discussed.",0

Methods A comprehensive systematic review and meta-analysis were conducted by an Expert Panel of the Japan Society of Gynecologic Oncology Ovarian Cancer Committee. Multiple public search engines including PubMed/MEDLINE and the Cochrane Database, were searched in March 2019 using the entry keywords “ovarian cancer [all fields] AND “interval debulking surgery [all fields]”, AND “neoadjuvant chemotherapy [all fields]”. Key inclusion criteria were prospective clinical trials examining platinum-based NACT for stage II-IV epithelial ovarian cancer. The primary outcome of interest was survival, and the secondary outcome was adverse events with each intervention. Results After screening 333 studies, four phase III randomized clinical trials were identified that met the inclusion criteria. These trials included 1692 women (847 receiving NACT-IDS and 845 receiving PDS). It was found that NACT-IDS and PDS had similar overall survival (hazard ratio [HR]: 0.97, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.87–1.07, P = 0.53) and progression-free survival (HR: 0.98, 95%CI: 0.90–1.08, P = 0.74). In contrast, NACT-IDS was associated with significantly lower rates of perioperative complications (odds ratio [OR] 0.27, 95%CI: 0.20–0.36, P  Conclusion This systematic review and meta-analysis suggests that NACT-IDS with carboplatin and paclitaxel does not negatively impact the survival of women with advanced ovarian cancer compared to PDS, while perioperative complications and mortality are significantly reduced by 70–80%.",0

,Primary Care Interventions for Prevention and Cessation of Tobacco Use in Children and Adolescents: A Systematic Review for the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force,"Background Interventions to discourage use of tobacco products among children and adolescents may help decrease tobacco-related illness. Tobacco products for this review include electronic nicotine delivery systems, often referred to as e-cigarettes. Purpose To systematically update the 2013 U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) review on primary care relevant interventions for tobacco use prevention and cessation in children and adolescents. Data Sources We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials and Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, MEDLINE, PsycINFO, and EMBASE (September 1, 2012 to June 25, 2019) with surveillance through February 7, 2020. Study Selection We selected primary care relevant studies based on inclusion and exclusion criteria developed for each key question. We included randomized and nonrandomized controlled trials of children and adolescents up to 18 years of age for cessation and 25 years of age for prevention. Trials that compared behavioral or pharmacological interventions with a no or minimal smoking intervention control group (e.g., usual care, attention control, wait list) were included. Data Extraction One investigator abstracted data and a second investigator checked data abstraction for accuracy. Two investigators independently assessed study quality using methods developed by the USPSTF. Data Synthesis (Results) Twenty-six trials met inclusion criteria. Behavioral interventions were associated with decreased likelihood of smoking initiation compared with control interventions (k=13, n=21,700; 7.4% vs. 9.2%; relative risk [RR] 0.82, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.73 to 0.92). In trials restricted to smokers, behavioral interventions had no effect on smoking prevalence (k=9, n=2,516, 80.7% vs. 84.1% continued smoking, RR 0.97, 95% CI, 0.93 to 1.01). Behavioral interventions were more effective than control interventions at decreasing smoking prevalence in trials of smokers and nonsmokers (k=7, n=10,533; 16.8% vs. 20.1%; RR 0.91, 95% CI, 0.83 to 0.995). However, these results were sensitive to inclusion of two trials of very intensive interventions. Two trials of bupropion and one trial of nicotine replacement therapy found no significant benefits of medication on likelihood of smoking cessation. One trial each found no evidence for a beneficial intervention effect on health outcomes or on adult smoking. Limitations Few trials addressed the prevention or cessation of tobacco products other than cigarettes; no trials evaluated effects of interventions on e-cigarette use. Trials of pharmacotherapy were few and had small sample sizes. Conclusions Behavioral interventions can reduce the likelihood of smoking initiation in nonsmoking youth and young adults. Research is needed to identify effective behavioral interventions for youth who smoke or who use other tobacco products and to understand the effectiveness of pharmacotherapy on cessation. Due to the rapid escalation of e-cigarette use among youth, both prevention and cessation trials that target and/or include e-cigarettes are imminently needed.",0

Objective To evaluate the effects of joint mobilisation on changes in clinical manifestations of sympathetic nervous system activity. Data sources MEDLINE, EMBASE, AMED, CINAHL, EBSCO, PubMed, PEDro, Cochrane Collaboration Trials Register, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews and SCOPUS databases. Study selection Randomised controlled trials that compared a mobilisation technique applied to the spine or the extremities with a control or placebo. Data extraction and data synthesis Human studies collecting data on skin conductance or skin temperature were used. Data were extracted by two reviewers. Risk of bias was assessed using the Cochrane guidelines, and quality of evidence was assessed using the GRADE approach. Standardised mean differences (SMD) and random effects were calculated. Results Eighteen studies were included in the review and 17 were included in the meta-analysis. The meta-analysis found a significant increase in skin conductance [SMD 1.21, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.88 to 1.53, n = 269] and a decrease in temperature (SMD 0.92, 95% CI −1.47 to −0.37, n = 128) after mobilisation compared with the control group. An increase in skin conductance (SMD 0.73, 95% CI 0.51 to 0.96, n = 293) and a decrease in temperature (SMD −0.50, 95% CI −0.82 to −0.18, n = 134) were seen after mobilisation compared with placebo. The risk of bias was generally low, but the heterogenicity of the results downgraded the level of evidence. Limitations Most trials (14/18) were conducted on asymptomatic healthy subjects. Conclusion There is moderate evidence suggesting a sympatho-excitatory effect of joint mobilisation. Systematic Review Registration Number PROSPERO CRD42018089991.",0
https://doi.org/10.1111/1440-1681.13238,"A systematic review of the effects of oleoylethanolamide, a high‐affinity endogenous ligand of PPAR‐α, on the management and prevention of obesity","Along with an increase in overweight and obesity among all age groups, the development of efficacious and safe anti-obesity strategies for patients, as well as health systems, is critical. Oleoylethanolamide (OEA), a high-affinity endogenous ligand of nuclear receptor peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha (PPAR-α), plays important physiological and metabolic actions. OEA is derived from oleic acid, a monounsaturated fatty acid, which has beneficial effects on body composition and regional fat distribution. The role of OEA in the modulation of food consumption and weight management makes it an attractive molecule requiring further exploration in obesogenic environments. This systematic review was conducted to assess the effects of OEA on the obesity management, with emphasizing on its physiological roles and possible mechanisms of action in energy homeostasis. We searched PubMed/Medline, Google Scholar, ScienceDirect, Scopus, ProQuest, and EMBASE up until September 2019. Out of 712 records screened, 30 articles met the study criteria. The evidence reviewed here indicates that OEA, an endocannabinoid-like compound, leads to satiation or meal termination through PPAR-α activation and fatty acid translocase (FAT)/CD36. Additionally, the lipid-amide OEA stimulates fatty acid uptake, lipolysis, and beta-oxidation, and also promotes food intake control. OEA also exerts satiety-inducing effects by activating the hedonic dopamine pathways and increasing homeostatic oxytocin and brain histamine. In conclusion, OEA may be a key component of the physiological system involved in the regulation of dietary fat consumption and energy homeostasis; therefore, it is suggested as a possible therapeutic agent for the management of obesity.",0

Electronic database searches of PubMed, EMBASE and Cochrane Library plus a hand search of conference proceedings were performed from inception to October 2019. The studies assessing the association between diabetes and antirheumatic agents in RA patients in cohort or case-control design were included. Data were pooled using fixed-effects or random-effects meta-analysis according to I 2 and pooled hazard ratios (HRs), and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were used as summary statistic. A total of 15 studies involving 552,019 patients with RA (11 for hydroxychloroquine , 7 for methotrexate , 6 for tumor necrosis factor inhibitors [TNFi], and 8 for glucocorticoids) were included. In pooled analysis, a reduced risk of diabetes was reported with hydroxychloroquine (meta-HR 0.61, 95% CI 0.56–0.66), methotrexate (meta-HR 0.81, 95% CI 0.75–0.87), TNFi (meta-HR 0.63, 95% CI 0.55–0.71), while glucocorticoids was associated with an increased risk of developing diabetes in a dose-dependent manner (Any dose: meta-HR 1.46, 95% CI 1.39–1.53; <10 mg/day prednisolone or equivalent: meta-HR 1.30, 95% CI 1.13–1.51; ≥10 mg/day prednisolone or equivalent: meta-HR 2.25, 95% CI 1.88–2.70). Hydroxychloroquine, methotrexate and TNFi were associated with decreased risk of diabetes, and glucocorticoids with increased risk in RA patients.

Surgical-site specific outcomes, such as infection, recurrence, and mesh explantation, are improving; however, successful repair still exposes the patient to what is often a complex major operation aimed at improving quality of life. Quality-of-life (QOL) outcomes, such as aesthetics, pain, and physical and emotional functioning, are less often and less well reported. We reviewed QOL tools currently available to evaluate their suitability.A systematic review of the literature in compliance with PRISMA guidelines was performed between 1st January 1990 and 1st May 2019. English language studies using validated quality-of-life assessment tool, whereby outcomes using this tool could be assessed were included.Heterogeneity in the QOL tool used for reporting outcome was evident throughout the articles reviewed. AWH disease-specific tools, hernia-specific tools, and generic tools were used throughout the literature with no obviously preferred or dominant method identified.Despite increasing acknowledgement of the need to evaluate QOL in patients with AWH, no tool has become dominant in this field. Assessment, therefore, of the impact of certain interventions or techniques on quality of life remains difficult and will continue to do so until an adequate standardised outcome measurement tool is available.",0

Data on overall survival (OS) and IBSEs, including progression-free survival (PFS), 6-month PFS (6moPFS), 12-month PFS (12moPFS), median PFS, and objective response rate (ORR) were extracted. Weighted linear regression analysis for the hazard ratio for OS and the hazard ratios or odds ratios for IBSEs was performed. The associations between IBSEs and OS were evaluated. Subgroup analyses according to disease stage (newly diagnosed glioblastoma versus recurrent glioblastoma), types of test treatment, and types of response assessment criteria were performed.Twenty-three phase III RCTs published between 2000 and 2017, including 8387 patients, met the inclusion criteria. OS showed strong correlations with PFS (standardized β coefficient [R] = 0.719), 6moPFS (R = 0.647), and 12moPFS (R = 0.638). OS showed no correlations with median PFS and ORR. In subgroup analysis according to types of therapies, PFS showed the highest correlations with OS in targeted therapies for cell cycle pathways (R = 0.913) and growth factor receptors and their downstream pathways (R = 0.962). 12moPFS showed the highest correlation with OS in antiangiogenic therapy (R = 0.821). The response assessment in neuro-oncology criteria provided higher correlation coefficients between OS and IBSEs than the Macdonald criteria.Overall, PFS is an optimized IBSE in targeted therapies for glioblastoma; however, 12moPFS is optimal in antiangiogenic therapy.",0

Currently it is considered a Neglected Tropical Disease, being endemic in specific locations within countries of the Americas, Asia, and Africa, while in Europe it is only rarely reported. The reason for a spatial inequality in the prevalence of leprosy in so-called endemic pockets within a country is still largely unexplained. A systematic review was conducted targeting leprosy transmission research data, using PubMed and Scopus as sources. Publications between January 1, 1945 and July 1, 2019 were included. The transmission pathways of M. leprae are not fully understood. Solid evidence exists of an increased risk for individuals living in close contact with leprosy patients, most likely through infectious aerosols, created by coughing and sneezing, but possibly also through direct contact. However, this systematic review underscores that human-to-human transmission is not the only way leprosy can be acquired. The transmission of this disease is probably much more complicated than was thought before. In the Americas, the nine-banded armadillo (Dasypus novemcinctus) has been established as another natural host and reservoir of M. leprae. Anthroponotic and zoonotic transmission have both been proposed as modes of contracting the disease, based on data showing identical M. leprae strains shared between humans and armadillos. More recently, in red squirrels (Sciurus vulgaris) with leprosy-like lesions in the British Isles M. leprae and M. lepromatosis DNA was detected. This finding was unexpected, because leprosy is considered a disease of humans (with the exception of the armadillo), and because it was thought that leprosy (and M. leprae) had disappeared from the United Kingdom. Furthermore, animals can be affected by other leprosy-like diseases, caused by pathogens phylogenetically closely related to M. leprae. These mycobacteria have been proposed to be grouped as a M. leprae-complex. We argue that insights from the transmission and reservoirs of members of the M. leprae-complex might be relevant for leprosy research. A better understanding of possible animal or environmental reservoirs is needed, because transmission from such reservoirs may partly explain the steady global incidence of leprosy despite effective and widespread multidrug therapy. A reduction in transmission cannot be expected to be accomplished by actions or interventions from the human healthcare domain alone, as the mechanisms involved are complex. Therefore, to increase our understanding of the intricate picture of leprosy transmission, we propose a One Health transdisciplinary research approach.",0

The studies excluded were those with a lack of information on outcomes and unreliable 95% CIs of the results.The Meta-analysis of Observational Studies in Epidemiology (MOOSE) guidelines were followed in selecting studies. Collected data were also scrutinized for reliable 95% CIs. Finally, studies were examined for perceived biases, their limitations, and the definitions of the outcomes.The HRs and 95% CIs were calculated for the incidence of ischemic stroke, hemorrhagic stroke, major bleeding, and mortality among patients receiving anticoagulants and those not receiving anticoagulants.Study selection yielded 15 studies with a total of 47 480 patients with atrial fibrillation and end-stage renal disease. Of these patients, 10 445 (22.0%) were taking warfarin. With a mean (SD) follow-up period of 2.6 (1.4) years, warfarin use was associated with no significant change for the risk of ischemic stroke (HR, 0.96; 95% CI, 0.82-1.13), with a significantly higher risk of hemorrhagic stroke (HR, 1.49; 95% CI, 1.03-1.94), with no significant difference in the risk of major bleeding (HR, 1.20; 95% CI, 0.99-1.47), and with no change in overall mortality (HR, 0.95; 95% CI, 0.83-1.09).In the studies reviewed, warfarin use appears to have been associated with no change in the incidence of ischemic stroke in patients with atrial fibrillation and end-stage renal disease. However, from the studies reviewed, it does appear to be associated with a significantly higher risk of hemorrhagic stroke, with no significant difference in the risk of major bleeding, and with no change in mortality.",0
https://doi.org/10.1093/gerona/glaa128,Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis on the Associations of Polypharmacy and Potentially Inappropriate Medication With Adverse Outcomes in Older Cancer Patients,"Abstract Background Both polypharmacy and potentially inappropriate medication (PIM) intake are highly prevailing in older cancer patients. However, only studies on the association of polypharmacy and postoperative complications have been meta-analyzed previously. Methods A systematic review and a meta-analysis of prospective/retrospective observational studies reporting associations of polypharmacy or PIM with at least one out of five predefined adverse health outcomes in a population of older cancer patients (≥60 years) were carried out. PubMed and Web of Science were used to search for relevant studies published between January 1991 and March 2020. Data were pooled by adopting a random-effects model. Results Overall, 42 publications were included in the systematic review. Meta-analyses could be performed on 39 studies about polypharmacy and 13 studies about PIM. Polypharmacy was found to be statistically significantly associated with all-cause mortality (risk ratio [95% confidence interval]: 1.37 [1.25–1.50]), hospitalization (1.53 [1.37–1.71]), treatment-related toxicity (1.22 [1.01–1.47]), and postoperative complications (1.73 [1.36–2.20]). The association of polypharmacy with prolongation of hospitalization was not statistically significant at the p &amp;lt; .05 significance level (1.62 [0.98–2.66]). With respect to PIM, a statistically significant association with all-cause mortality (1.43 [1.08–1.88]) was observed but not with other adverse outcomes. Conclusions Polypharmacy was found to be associated with several adverse outcomes and PIM use with all-cause mortality in older cancer patients. However, these results should be interpreted with caution because about three-quarters of the studies identified did not adjust for comorbidity and are prone to confounding by indication.",0

https://doi.org/10.1002/art.41206,Effect of Therapy on Radiographic Progression in Axial Spondyloarthritis: A Systematic Review and Meta‐Analysis,"Objective To investigate the effect of therapies on radiographic progression in patients with axial spondyloarthritis (SpA). Methods A comprehensive database search for studies assessing radiographic progression in axial SpA (particular treatment versus no treatment of interest) was performed. Study-specific standardized mean differences in treatment outcomes at 2 and ≥4 years were estimated and combined using random-effects models. Results Twenty-four studies in patients with axial SpA were identified, of which 18 involved tumor necrosis factor inhibitors (TNFi), 8 involved nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), and 1 involved secukinumab. Spinal radiographic progression, as measured by the modified Stoke Ankylosing Spondylitis Spine Score (mSASSS), was not significantly different between TNFi-treated and biologics-naive patients at 2 years (mSASSS difference -0.73 [95% confidence interval (95% CI) -1.52, 0.12], I2 = 28%) and ≥4 years (mSASSS difference -2.03 [95% CI -4.63, 0.72], I2 = 63%). Sensitivity analyses restricted to studies with a low risk of bias showed a significant difference in spinal radiographic progression between TNFi-treated and biologics-naive patients at ≥4 years (mSASSS difference -2.17 [95% CI -4.19, -0.15]). No significant difference in spinal radiographic progression was observed between NSAID-treated and control patients (mSASSS difference -0.30 [95% CI -2.62, 1.31], I2 = 71%) or between secukinumab-treated and biologics-naive patients (mSASSS difference -0.34 [95% CI -0.85, 0.17]). With regard to treatment differences in patients with nonradiographic axial SpA or in patients with radiographic progression measured using the sacroiliac joint score, an insufficient number of studies were available for analysis. Conclusion Although no significant protective effect of TNFi treatment on spinal radiographic progression was seen over the course of 2 years or ≥4 years in patients with axial SpA, our analysis restricted to studies with a low risk of bias showed a protective effect of TNFi after ≥4 years. Therefore, long-term TNFi exposure might confer beneficial effects on spinal radiographic progression in axial SpA. No difference in radiographic progression at 2 years was seen in either the NSAID or secukinumab treatment groups compared to their controls. Future studies should explore the effects of biologic treatment on radiographic progression, as well as the effects of long-term biologics exposure, in patients with early axial SpA or those with nonradiographic axial SpA.",0
https://doi.org/10.3324/haematol.2019.245803,Geriatric assessment in older patients with a hematologic malignancy: a systematic review,"The aim of this systematic review is to give an update of all currently available evidence on the relevance of a geriatric assessment in the treatment of older patients with hematologic malignancies. A systematic search in MEDLINE and EMBASE was performed to find studies in which a geriatric assessment was used to detect impaired geriatric domains or to address the association between geriatric assessment and survival or clinical outcome measures. The literature search included 4,629 reports, of which 54 publications from 44 studies were included. Seventy-three percent of the studies were published in the last 5 years. The median age of the patients was 73 years (range, 58-86) and 71% had a good World Health Organization (WHO) performance status. The median prevalence of geriatric impairments varied between 17% and 68%, even in patients with a good WHO performance status. Polypharmacy, nutritional status and instrumental activities of daily living were most frequently impaired. Whereas several geriatric impairments and frailty (based on a frailty screening tool or summarized geriatric assessment score) were predictive for a shorter overall survival, WHO performance status lost its predictive value in most studies. The association between geriatric impairments and treatment-related toxicity varied, with a trend towards a higher risk of (non-)hematologic toxicity in frail patients. During the follow-up, frailty seemed to be associated with treatment non-completion, especially when patients were malnourished. Patients with a good physical capacity had a shorter stay in hospital and a lower rate of hospitalization. Geriatric assessment, even in patients with a good performance status, can detect impaired geriatric domains and these impairments may be predictive of mortality. Moreover, geriatric impairments suggest a higher risk of treatment-related toxicity, treatment non-completion and use of healthcare services. A geriatric assessment should be considered before starting treatment in older patients with hematologic malignancies.",0

This review summarized current reported outcomes of MHL SABR.This systematic review, based on the PRISMA guidelines, was performed using MEDLINE® (PubMed®), EMBASE and Cochrane Library databases from inception until December 2018. Studies reporting outcomes from SABR specifically for MHL from all primary malignancies were included. Non- English studies, guidelines, reviews, non-peer reviewed correspondences were excluded. Only the most recent publication and/or largest cohort from a single institution would be included for analysis.From the 222 studies identified, 4 retrospective studies totaling 196 patients were included in the analysis. One study included a small number of patients receiving non-ablative doses of stereotactic radiotherapy (RT). Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) was the most common primary (65%), followed by breast (8%). Median follow-up ranged between 12 and 32 months. Reported dose and fractionation ranged from 21 to 60 Gy in 3-11 fractions, with median BED10 ranged from 46-106 Gy10. Three studies reported local control (LC) rates: study 1, 97% (1-year) and 77% (5-year); study 4, 88% (2-year); and study 2, 69% (6-month) and 66% (16-month). Pooled grade 3-5 toxicity rate according to Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) v4.0 was 6% (n=11). Pooled SABR-related mortality (grade 5 toxicity) rate was 2% (n=4). Three SABR-related deaths from esophageal fistulae (2 to trachea, 1 to mediastinum) were reported, with all 3 having prior RT to the subcarinal nodes.Our review suggested SABR for MHL to be feasible and effective, though there is a potential for serious toxicity especially in the re-irradiation scenario. Multi-institutional and/or prospective studies will help determine the therapeutic benefit of SABR in this high-risk treatment scenario.",0

Systematic review and meta‐analysis,"This systematic review aimed to evaluate the association of traumatic dental injury (TDI) on oral health-related to quality of life (OHRQoL) in children and adolescents.A focused structured question using Population (P), Exposition (E), Comparisons (C), Outcomes (O) (PECO) was designed: ""Does traumatic dental injury impact OHRQoL of children and adolescents?"" A broad search according to Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) was conducted. Evaluation criteria of methodological quality and risk of bias control were applied to selected articles. A fixed-effect model was used for the meta-analysis, and the quality of the evidence was performed using Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach.Nineteen studies were qualified with moderate to high quality, and 11 studies were considered for meta-analysis. Negative impact on OHRQoL was detected for children in the symptoms domain (P = .005; IC; -0.07 [-0.12, -0.02]) with moderate certainty of evidence quality level (GRADE). For adolescents, the total scale and all domain presented statistical significance (P < .05) with moderate certainty of evidence in the areas of functional limitation and social well-being (GRADE).Based on articles with moderate to high quality, the impact of TDI on OHRQoL in children under age 10 was only significant in the symptom domain using Early Childhood Oral Health Impact Scale (ECOHIS). The impact of TDI on OHRQoL in early adolescents aged 11 to 14 was significant in every assessed domain using Child Perception Questionnaire (CPQ11-14). However, future studies should be done improving the available certainty of evidence considered moderate. (CRD42016035686).",0

Developing culturally appropriate interventions is paramount to closing the gap in these health inequities. The purpose of this systematic review is to critically evaluate health promotion interventions for African Americans delivered in two environments that are frequented by this population: barbershops and hair salons. Characteristics of effective interventions will be identified and evidence for the effectiveness of these interventions will be provided. Results of this review will inform future health promotion efforts for African Americans particularly focused on the leading health inequities in obesity-related chronic diseases: cardiovascular disease, cancer and type 2 diabetes. Methods and analysis Subject headings and keywords will be used to search for synonyms of ‘barbershops,’ ‘hair salons’ and ‘African Americans’ to identify all relevant articles (from inception onwards) in the following databases: Academic Search Ultimate, Cumulative Index of Nursing and Allied Health Literature, Embase, PsycINFO, PubMed, Web of Science (Science Citation Index and Social Sciences Citation Index) and ProQuest Dissertations. Experimental and quasi-experimental studies for adult ( &gt; 18 years) African Americans delivered in barbershops and hair salons will be included. Eligible interventions will include risk reduction/management of obesity-related chronic disease: cardiovascular disease, cancer and type 2 diabetes. Two reviewers will independently screen, select and extract data and a third will mediate disagreements. The methodological quality (or risk of bias) of individual studies will be appraised using the Effective Public Health Practice Project Quality Assessment Tool. Quality and content of the evidence will be narratively synthesised. Ethics and dissemination Since this is a protocol for a systematic review, ethical approval is not required. Findings from the review will be widely disseminated through conference presentations, peer-reviewed publications and traditional and social media outlets.",0
https://doi.org/10.1016/j.arr.2020.101061,"Instrumented measures of sedentary behaviour and physical activity are associated with mortality in community-dwelling older adults: A systematic review, meta-analysis and meta-regression analysis","• High instrumented sedentary behaviour (i-SB) and low instrumented physical activity (i-PA) are associated with a higher mortality risk. • Adjustments for relatively higher or lower levels of i-PA for i-SB or i-PA, respectively, attenuated these associations. • The highest mortality risk for i-PA was found for total i-PA, suggesting all physical activity levels contribute to lowering mortality risk. Sedentary behaviour (SB) and physical activity (PA) can be objectively assessed with inertial sensors to describe bodily movement. Higher SB and lower PA is associated with higher chronological age and negative health outcomes. This study aimed to quantify the association between instrumented measures of SB (i-SB) and PA (i-PA) and mortality in community-dwelling older adults, to subsequently compare the quantitative effect sizes and to determine the dose-response relationships. An electronic search in six databases from inception to 27th of June 2019 was conducted. All articles reporting on i-SB or i-PA and mortality in community-dwelling older adults aged 60 years or older were considered eligible. A meta-analysis was conducted for the association between i-SB and i-PA and mortality expressed in Hazard Ratios (HR) and 95% Confidence Intervals (95% CI). A meta-regression analysis was performed to determine the dose-response relationship between i-SB and steps per day and mortality. Twelve prospective articles representing eleven cohorts, reporting data of 38,141 participants were included. In total 2502 (6.4%) participants died during follow-up (2.0 to 9.8 years). Comparing the most sedentary with the least sedentary groups of participants resulted in a pooled HR of 2.44 (95% CI 1.82–3.25). Comparing the least active with the most active groups of participants resulted in a pooled HR of 1.93 (95% CI 1.39-2.69); 2.66 (95% CI 2.11–3.35); 3.43 (95% CI 2.61–4.52), and 3.09 (95% CI 2.33–4.11) for light, moderate-to-vigorous-, total PA and steps per day, respectively. Meta-regression analyses showed clear dose-response relationships between i-SB and steps per day and mortality risk. Both i-SB and i-PA are significantly associated with mortality in community-dwelling older adults, showing the largest effect size for total physical activity. Dose-response relationships could be observed for i-SB and steps per day.",0

Treatment options for Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) are limited in terms of available drugs and the success of psychotherapeutic interventions. Oxytocin is a peptide involved in the modulation of social cognition, emotional skills and the reward system, all deficient in PTSD, and thus it has been suggested as a promising pharmacological target. In this systematic review, the potential effects of intranasal OT (INOT) administration on core symptoms in PTSD patients are discussed, as well as neurobiological correlates in functional imaging supporting its clinical evidence. The fourteen studies included in the present review provide tentative evidence that INOT could be a safe pharmacological intervention, although the results were mixed and insufficient to quantify the effectiveness of this intervention. Specifically, the primary outcome measures differed consistently between studies, and the sample sizes were usually small. Considering the neurobiological and clinical evidences, tentative hypotheses can be made on the possible role of INOT in facilitating socially- and goal-oriented cognition and behaviour, thus promoting a better therapeutic alliance and treatment outcome. Such strategies need to be further supported by literature. For instance, only one study to date has directly investigated the use of INOT as an augmentation strategy for psychotherapy (namely, Prolonged Exposure therapy) and for a limited time, nevertheless providing promising results for the efficacy and the medium-term tolerability of this drug after multiple administrations.",0

However, there is debate over the comparative effectiveness of these drugs in preventing hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of the effectiveness of TDF vs entecavir in reducing the incidence of HCC among patients with chronic HBV infection.We performed a systematic review of the MEDLINE, EMBASE, Web of Science, and Cochrane Library from 2010 through 2019 for full-text articles and conference abstracts on studies of effects of TDF vs entecavir in patients with HBV infection. Extracted data were analyzed with the random-effects model. Potential sources of heterogeneity were investigated using sensitivity, meta-regression, and subgroup analyses.Our final analysis comprised 15 studies (61,787 patients; 16,101 patients given TDF and 45,686 given entecavir). TDF treatment was associated with a significantly lower risk of HCC than entecavir (hazard ratio, 0.80; 95% CI, 0.69-0.93; P = .003; I2 = 13%). The lower risk of HCC in patients given TDF compared with entecavir persisted in sensitivity and subcohort analyses performed with propensity score-matched cohorts and cirrhosis subcohorts. Inclusion of patients with decompensated cirrhosis and the sample size were the factors with the largest effects on between-study heterogeneity in meta-regression analyses. Subsequent subgroup analyses showed no statistical differences in the incidence of death or transplantation (hazard ratio, 0.93; 95% CI, 0.73-1.17; P = .519; I2 = 6%) between patients given TDF vs entecavir.In a meta-analysis of studies of patients with chronic HBV infection, we found that TDF treatment was associated with a significantly lower (20%) risk of HCC than entecavir treatment. Randomized trials are needed to support this finding.",0

Scientific data reviewed herein showed that extracts prepared from medicinal and edible mushrooms and their individual metabolites presented antiinflammatory, antioxidant, photoprotective, antimicrobial, anti-tyrosinase, anti-elastase, and anticollagenase activities. These metabolites can be utilised as ingredients to suppress the severity of Inflammatory Skin Diseases, offer photoprotection to the skin, and correct Hyperpigmentation. However, studies regarding the molecular mechanism behind the mentioned bioactivities are still lacking. Challenges associated with the use of mushroom extracts and their associated metabolites as cosmeceutical and nutricosmetic ingredients include several steps from the fruiting bodies to the final product: extraction optimization, estimation of the efficacy and safety claims, the use of micro and nanocarriers to allow for controlled release and the pros and cons associated with the use of extracts vs individual compounds. This systematic review highlights that mushrooms contain diverse biomolecules that can be sustainably used in the development of nutricosmetic and cosmeceutical formulations. Reports regarding stability, compatibility, and safety assessment, but also toxicological studies are still needed to be considered. Furthermore, some of the constraints and limitations hindering the development of this type of ingredients still require long-term studies to achieve major breakthroughs.",0

Only 2 published randomized clinical trials were found, with a pooled sample size of 183 (RIC, 92; MAC, 91). Both studies suggested an overall survival advantage after RIC, with a pooled hazard ratio (HR) of .67 (95% confidence interval [CI], .41 to 1.09) for RIC versus MAC. Relapse results were also concordant, with a pooled HR of 1.55 (95% CI, .74 to 3.25) for RIC versus MAC. Neither result was statistically significant. Comparisons for other outcomes were unremarkable. In conclusion, the evidence for the optimal conditioning intensity in myelodysplastic syndromes is weak. Post-transplant maintenance strategies and incorporation of genomic information into decision-making may improve post-transplant outcomes.",0

Objective To conduct a systematic review of the adverse dermatologic effects and predisposing factors of hydroxychloroquine toxicity. Results The review included 94 articles comprising 689 dermatologic adverse effects. A total of 21 unique dermatologic reactions were reported, most commonly drug eruption or rash (358 cases), cutaneous hyperpigmentation (116), pruritus (62), acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis (27), Stevens-Johnson syndrome or toxic epidermal necrolysis (26), hair loss (12), and stomatitis (11). Almost all underlying conditions were rheumatologic or autoimmune in nature, composed primarily of lupus erythematous (72% of all cases) and rheumatoid arthritis (14%). The range of reported mean cumulative dosages was wide, with some adverse reactions found after as little as 3 g or as much as 2500 g. Limitations Dermatologic adverse events and primary diagnoses related to the use of hydroxychloroquine may be under-reported as only case reports and clinical trials that reported at least 1 dermatologic adverse effect were included.

https://doi.org/10.5551/jat.52928,The Relationship of Coronary Artery Calcium and Clinical Coronary Artery Disease with Cognitive Function: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis,"Aim Coronary artery disease (CAD) and cognitive impairment are common in the elderly, with evidence for shared risk factors and pathophysiological processes. The coronary artery calcium (CAC) score is a marker of subclinical CAD, which may allow early detection of individuals prone to cognitive decline. Prior studies on associations of CAC and clinical CAD with cognitive impairment had discrepant results. This systematic review aims to evaluate the association of (sub)clinical CAD with cognitive function, cognitive decline, and diagnosis of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) or dementia. Methods A systematic search was conducted in MEDLINE, Embase, and Web of Science until February 2019, supplemented with citations tracking. Two reviewers independently screened studies and extracted information including odds ratios (ORs) and hazard ratios (HRs). Results Forty-six studies, 10 on CAC and 36 on clinical CAD, comprising 1,248,908 participants were included in the systematic review. Studies about associations of (sub)clinical CAD with cognitive function and cognitive decline had heterogeneous methodology and inconsistent findings. Two population-based studies investigated the association between CAC and risk of dementia over 6-12.2 years using different CAC scoring methods. Both found a tendency toward higher risk of dementia as CAC severity increased. Meta-analysis in 15 studies (663,250 individuals) showed an association between CAD and MCI/dementia (pooled OR 1.32, 95%CI 1.17-1.48) with substantial heterogeneity (I2=87.0%, p＜0.001). Pooled HR of CAD for incident MCI/dementia over 3.2-25.5 years in six longitudinal studies (70,060 individuals) was 1.51 (95%CI 1.24-1.85), with low heterogeneity (I2=14.1%, p=0.32). Sensitivity analysis did not detect any study that was of particular influence on the pooled OR or HR. Conclusions Limited evidence suggests the CAC score is associated with risk of dementia. In clinical CAD, risk of MCI and dementia is increased by 50%, as supported by stronger evidence.",0

This may be achieved by preconditioning. Thermal preconditioning refers to the supraphysiological heating of organisms or specific organs prior to an environmental insult. This review explores the current application and efficacy of thermal preconditioning for surgery. <h3>Methods</h3> A comprehensive search of Medline (via PubMed), Embase and the Cochrane library was performed. Only articles evaluating the use of supraphysiological heating prior to a surgical intervention were included. Qualitative syntheses of data were undertaken due to the heterogeneity of the studies. The quality of each article was appraised using risk of bias tools (Cochrane and SYRCLE). <h3>Results</h3> The primary literature search returned 3175 articles. After screening and reviewing reference lists, 28 papers met the inclusion criteria. The majority of studies were performed in animals, with only three clinical trials. Although there was broad coverage of different surgical techniques, flap transfer was the most commonly performed procedure. Most studies demonstrated a beneficial effect of thermal preconditioning, ranging from increased joint mobility to improved flap or organ transplant survival rates. The quality of evidence was variable, with experimental animal studies limited by a lack of methodological detail. <h3>Conclusions</h3> Thermal preconditioning for surgery has been primarily investigated using animal models. A beneficial effect has been demonstrated in most cases, across specialties ranging from plastic to general surgery. Future studies should aim to assess the clinical significance through large multicentre randomised controlled trials.",0

MPs alone and in combination with pollutants can potentially cause significant harm to organisms and human beings. Weathering of MPs under various environmental stresses increases the uncertainty of their environmental fates. Compared with field surveys, laboratory simulation experiments are appropriate to simplify the research procedures and investigate the mechanisms. In this review, the effects of abrasion, solar radiation, chemical and thermal oxidation, microbial adhesion and colonization, and other environmental factors on the MPs and the relative laboratory simulation methods were summarized and discussed. Photo-oxidation and abrasion are the most appliable methods due to easy operation and adjustable weathering degree. Furthermore, the structural and components changes in weathering process and the applied characterization methods were generalized. In addition, one of important environmental behaviors, adsorption of the weathered MPs towards two typical pollutants was analyzed. Finally, three priorities for research were proposed. This paper conducts systematic summarized of the MPs weathering process and provides a reference for future studies to accurately determine the environmental risks of weathering MPs.",0

However, the effect of metformin on gastric cancer risk and survival rate in T2DM patients remains controversial. Therefore, we conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to evaluate the effect of metformin on gastric cancer in T2DM patients. We searched PubMed, EMBASE, Medline and the Cochrane Library for related studies up to October 22, 2019. Pooled hazard ratios with 95% confidence intervals were calculated using random-effects model. Heterogeneity was assessed. All articles were evaluated by Newcastle–Ottawa Scale. A total of 11 cohort studies met eligibility criteria and were included in the meta-analysis. The use of metformin was related to a significant 21% reduction in GC incidence (HR 0.790; 95% CI 0.624–1.001). Subgroup analysis showed that the use of metformin significantly reduced the risk of gastric cancer in T2DM patients in Asian populations, but not in western populations. In a pooled analysis of 3 studies, metformin use was associated with increased overall survival rate (HR 0.817; 95% CI 0.600–1.113) and cancer-specific survival rate (HR 0.824; 95% CI 0.614–1.106) of T2DM patients. Metformin could reduce the risk of gastric cancer in T2DM patients, particularly in Asian populations. However, it is debatable whether metformin use can improve the prognosis of gastric cancer in T2DM patients.",0
https://doi.org/10.1016/j.euf.2020.04.012,Radiation Exposure During Prostatic Artery Embolisation: A Systematic Review and Calculation of Associated Risks,"Although evidence supporting the efficacy and safety of prostatic artery embolisation (PAE) is increasing, potential associated risks of ionising radiation in this context remain largely unknown. We systematically reviewed reports on radiation exposure (RE) during PAE in the literature and estimated the risk RE poses using a Monte Carlo dose calculation algorithm. Of 842 studies screened, 22 were included. The overall mean dose area product (DAP) was 181.6 Gy∙cm2 (95% confidence interval 125.7-262.4). The risk model for the effects of RE in a 66-yr-old patient exposed to DAP of 200 Gy∙cm2 showed that the probability of cancer death from the intervention was 0.117%. The highest specific lifetime risk was expected for leukaemia (0.061%). Wide DAP variation between individual studies (medians ranging from 33.2 to 863.4 Gy∙cm2) indicate large potential to reduce RE during PAE at some study centres. RE must be included in patient counselling on PAE, especially for younger patients. PATIENT SUMMARY: We systematically assessed radiation exposure during prostatic artery embolisation (PAE) in the literature and simulated the associated risks in a computer model. PAE exposes patients to very low but not negligible risks, which are most relevant for younger men. This should be discussed with patients before PAE.",0

Available studies with search terms such as: Impression disinfection, disinfection method, impression dimensional stability and impression wettability were used. The selected articles were reviewed by screening their titles and abstracts and full text. Finally, a total of 70 articles were considered relevant and were included in this study.Extensive studies were conducted to determine the effect of the different disinfection methods and materials on the properties of the different impression materials such as dimensional stability, wettability and surface roughness. While some studies reported significant changes in the properties of the impression materials, others reported either no changes or minor insignificant effects.Some studies reported significant changes in the properties of the impression materials as a result of using different disinfection methods, whereas others reported either minor insignificant or no changes. Although the findings of the studies were controversial, care should be taken to avoid distortion of impressions and loss of their surface details that can adversely affect the fitting accuracy of the restorations. Therefore, better designed and standardized studies are needed to evaluate the effect of different commonly used disinfectants on properties of impression materials. Moreover, manufacturers should be encouraged to recommend specific disinfection methods and materials for disinfecting the impression materials to ensure their optimal accuracy.",0
https://doi.org/10.1016/j.marpolbul.2020.111264,Knowledge gaps in ecotoxicology studies of marine environments in Pacific Island Countries and Territories – A systematic review,"The Pacific Island Countries and Territories (PICTs) are heavily dependent on the marine resources for food security, employment, government revenue and economic development, hence the concern about the potential exposure of these resources to pollutants. The main goal of this review was to identify ecotoxicology studies published that were done in PICTs. Four major gaps were identified: i) a quantitative gap, with low number of studies published on the PICTs; ii) a geographic gap, where ecotoxicology studies have unevenly covered the different PICTs; iii) a temporal gap, as no biological effect monitoring study has so far been published for the PICTs; and, iv) a pollutants gap, as all of the PICTs studies focused mainly on environmental monitoring studying on average two types of pollutants (heavy metals and pesticides) per PICT only. We suggest, therefore, the potential risk to the marine environment to be estimated by assessing the fate of pollutants via chemical and biological effect monitoring.",0
https://doi.org/10.1111/apa.15132,Infant neurobehavioural consequences of prenatal cigarette exposure: A systematic review and meta‐analysis,"Prenatal exposure to cigarettes leads to alterations in brain development during pregnancy. This has an impact on postnatal psychological and behavioural processes, affecting an infant's neurobehavioural profile with little known about which aspects are affected. The evidence was synthesized to assess the effects of prenatal cigarette smoke exposure on neurobehavioural outcomes within the first year of life.  Methods: Six databases were searched (Web of science core collections, MEDLINE, Psychinfo, CINAHL, EBSCOhost ebook collection, Opengrey) in November 2018. Eligible studies (n=17) had to include a measure of prenatal cigarette exposure and a neurobehavioural assessment ≤1 year of age.  Results: In the first year of life specific areas of neurobehavioural functioning are related to prenatal cigarette exposure with eight out of 10 areas of neurobehaviour having significant medium (negative affect, attention, excitability, irritability and orientation) or small (muscle tone, regulation and difficult temperament) pooled effect sizes. Only lethargy and stress did not show any significant pooled effects.  Conclusion: Prenatal cigarette exposure affects a significant range of behaviours during the first year of life.",0
https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph17082744,Risk Factors for Upper Limb Injury in Tennis Players: A Systematic Review,"Studies in tennis injuries have successfully identified the incident rate, the location, and the type of the injury. The majority of the studies have multiple perspectives (epidemiology, biomechanics, performance), however only a few studies were able to identify risk factors or mechanisms that contribute to tennis injuries. Until now, there has not been a systematic literature review that identifies risk factors for tennis injuries. The objective of this review was to identify and critically appraise the evidence related to risk factors for upper limb injury in tennis players. A systematic review was conducted in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) framework, using a research question developed by the Patient Problem, (or Population) Intervention, Comparison or Control, and Outcome (PICO) methodology. The quality of the studies included was moderate to low, indicating prolonged tennis (exposure to tennis), scapular dyskinesis, muscle fatigue, scapulothoracic properties, shoulder kinetics or kinematics, skill level, and technique as risk factors for upper limb injury in tennis players. In this review, it is evidenced that the majority of tennis injuries are associated with overuse and a chronic time course, however, tennis injuries do not arise from a linear combination of isolated and predictive factors. Therefore, the multifactorial and complex nature of tennis injuries has to be further examined. The necessity of more randomized control trial studies is highly recommended.",0

However, SPX may be associated with a higher risk of recurrence compared with bowel resection (BR). We sought to compare morbidity and recurrence following SPX and BR in patients with fibrostenotic CD. A systematic review was performed according to PRISMA and MOOSE guidelines. Observational studies that compared outcomes of CD patients undergoing either SPX or BR were identified. Log hazard ratios (InHR) for recurrence-free survival (RFS) and their standard errors were calculated from Kaplan–Meier plots or Cox regression models and pooled using the inverse variance method. Dichotomous variables were pooled as odds ratios (OR) using the Mantel–Haenszel method. Continuous variables were pooled as weighted mean differences. Twelve studies of 1026 CD patients (SPX n = 444, 43.27%; BR with or without SPX n = 582, 56.72%) were eligible for inclusion. There was an increased likelihood of disease recurrence with SPX than with BR (OR 1.61; 95% CI, 1.03, 2.52; p = 0.04; I2 = 0%). Patients who had a SPX alone had a significantly reduced RFS than those who underwent BR (HR 1.47; 95% CI, 1.08, 2.01; p = 0.02; I2 = 0%). There was no difference in morbidity between the groups (OR 0.58; 95% CI, 0.26, 1.28; p = 0.18; I2 = 0%). SPX should only be performed in those patients with Crohn’s strictures that are at high risk for short bowel syndrome and intestinal failure; otherwise, BR is the favored surgical technique for the management of fibrostenotic CD.",0
https://doi.org/10.1111/zph.12706,Post‐exposure rabies prophylaxis for mass bat exposures: Case series and systematic review,"To assess and describe the use of rabies post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) related to mass bat exposures (MBEs) in the literature and in the state of Rhode Island. Data on MBE events occurring between 2010 and 2016 from the Rhode Island Department of Health (RIDOH) were reviewed to determine PEP usage. For comparison, a systematic review was also performed by searching PubMed, EMBASE, Cochrane Library and Web of Science using the keywords 'rabies,' 'bat' and 'exposure.' There were three MBE events in Rhode Island between 2010 and 2016 in which groups of individuals were asleep during the potential exposure. As a result, RIDOH provided PEP to those involved in the event. In a systematic review of 12 published reports, a variety of settings were involved in MBEs: camping sites, a domestic flight, a neonatal intensive care unit and dormitories. The number of potential rabies exposures ranged from five to 1,429 people. PEP recommendations for assessed persons ranged from 0% to 100% across events (median 21%). The variation in PEP recommendations following a MBE may be dependent on medical need, past precedent or preference. Federal guidance for MBE is needed to add clarity and to minimize the variability in PEP recommendations for such events in the future.",0
https://doi.org/10.1007/s13304-020-00819-1,Laparoscopic versus open complete mesocolic excision: a systematic review by updated meta-analysis,"Recent evidence has proven the non-inferiority of laparoscopic complete mesocolic excision (LCME) to open complete mesocolic excision (OCME) with regard to feasibility and oncological safety. However, the differences in survival benefits between the 2 procedures have not been assessed. The aim of this study was to evaluate whether or not one procedure was superior to the other using updated meta-analysis. A systematic search for relevant literature was performed in Pubmed, Embase, Cochrane library and Google scholar databases. This meta-analysis included retrospective studies and one randomised controlled trial comparing LCME to OSCME. LCME to OCME was evaluated using updated meta-analysis. The Newcastle–Ottawa scale was used to assess the methodologic quality of the studies. Fixed- and random-effects models were used, and survival outcomes were assessed using the inverse variance hazard ratio (HR) method. Operative time was significantly shorter in the OCME cohort than in the LCME cohort. Blood loss, wound infections, time to flatus, time to oral feeding, and length of hospital stay were significantly shorter in the LCME cohort than in the OCME cohort. The 1-, 3-, and 5-year overall survivals were better in the LCME cohort than in the OCME cohort ([HR = 0.37 (0.22, 0.65); p = 0.004], [HR = 0.48 (0.31, 0.74); p = 0.008], and [HR = 0.64 (0.45, 0.93); p = 0.02], respectively). No difference in the 1-year disease-free survival (DFS) between the 2 procedures was observed ([HR = 0.68 (0.44, 1.03); p = 0.07]). In contrast, the LCME cohort had better 3- and 5-year DFS rates than those of the OCME cohort ([HR = 0.63 (0.42, 0.97), p = 0.03] and [HR = 0.68 (0.56, 0.83), p = 0.001], respectively). The results of the present study must be interpreted cautiously because the included studies were retrospective from single centres. Therefore, selection, institutional and national bias may have influenced the results. LCME is associated with the faster postoperative recovery and some better potential survival benefits than OCME.",0

A Systematic Review with Meta-Analyses,"Composite dust generation is most likely a continuous and daily procedure in dental practice settings. The aim of this systematic review was to identify, compile and evaluate existing evidence on interventions and composite material properties related to the production of aerosolized dust during routine dental procedures. Seven electronic databases were searched, with no limits, supplemented by a manual search, on 27 April 2020 for published and unpublished research. Eligibility criteria comprised of studies of any design, describing composite dust production related to the implementation of any procedure in dental practice. Study selection, data extraction and risk of bias (RoB) assessment was undertaken independently either in duplicate, or confirmed by a second reviewer. Random effects meta-analyses of standardized mean differences (SMD) with associated 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were employed where applicable. A total of 375 articles were initially identified, resulting in 13 articles being included in the qualitative synthesis, of which 5 contributed to meta-analyses overall. Risk of bias recordings ranged between low and high, pertaining to unclear/raising some concerns, in most cases. All types of composites, irrespective of the filler particles, released significant amounts of nano-sized particles after being ground, with potentially disruptive respiratory effects. Evidence supported increased % distribution of particles &lt; 100 nm for nanocomposite Filtek Supreme XTE compared to both conventional hybrid Z100MP (SMD: 1.96, 95% CI: 0.85, 3.07; p-value; 0.001) and nano- hybrid Tetric EvoCeram (SMD: 1.62, 95% CI: 0.56, 2.68; p-value: 0.003). For cytotoxicity considerations of generated aerosolized particles, both nanocomposites Filtek Supreme XTE and nanohybrid GradiO revealed negative effects on bronchial epithelial cell viability, as represented by % formazan reduction at 330–400 μg/mL for 24 hours, with no recorded differences between them (SMD: 0.19; 95% CI: −0.17, 0.55; p-value: 0.30). Effective and more rigorous management of dental procedures potentially liable to the generation of considerable amounts of aerosolized composite dust should be prioritized in contemporary dental practice. In essence, protective measures for the clinician and the practices’ personnel should also be systematically promoted and additional interventions may be considered in view of the existing evidence.",0

This study investigated the BSI in mCRPC and its relationship with prognosis. Methods The PubMed, Cochrane, and Embase databases were searched systematically for relevant articles published before September 1, 2019. Hazard ratios (HRs) were used to investigate the prognostic value. Results This study finally identified 9 eligible studies. The results suggested that high baseline BSI predicted poor OS (HR = 1.331, 95% CI: 1.081–1.640) and that elevated ΔBSI also predicted poor OS (HR = 1.220, 95% CI: 1.015–1.467). The subgroup analysis stratified by ethnicity showed that the baseline BSI and ΔBSI predicted poor OS in the Asian population but not in the Caucasian population. We also performed a subgroup analysis based on the different cut-off values of baseline BSI. The subgroup of ≤1 showed a significant association with OS in mCRPC patients. Conclusion Our study demonstrated that high baseline BSI and elevated ΔBSI predicted poor OS in patients with mCRPC. Hence, the BSI can serve as a prognostic indicator for mCRPC patients and may therefore guide clinical treatment in the future.",0

Methods We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO and CINAHL to August 2019 and used thematic synthesis to analyse the findings. Results From 26 studies involving 451 people with juvenile-onset rheumatic conditions we identified six themes: a sense of belonging (comfort in familiarity, connectedness in shared experiences, reassurance in being with others of a similar age, desire for normality and acceptance); preparedness for sudden changes (confidence through guided introductions to the adult environment, rapport from continuity of care, security in a reliable point of contact, minimizing lifestyle disruptions); abandonment and fear of the unknown (abrupt and forced independence, ill-equipped to hand over medical information, shocked by meeting adults with visible damage and disability, vulnerability in the loss of privacy); anonymous and dismissed in adult care (deprived of human focus, sterile and uninviting environment, disregard of debilitating pain and fatigue); quest for autonomy (controlled and patronized in the paediatric environment, liberated from the authority of others, freedom to communicate openly); and tensions in parental involvement (overshadowed by parental presence, guilt of excluding parents, reluctant withdrawal of parental support). Conclusion Young people feel dismissed, abandoned, ill-prepared and out of control during transition. However, successful transition can be supported by preparing for changes, creating a sense of belonging and negotiating parental involvement and autonomy. Incorporating patient-identified priorities into transitional services may improve satisfaction and outcomes in young people with juvenile-onset rheumatic conditions.",0

A systematic review,"There is a lack of effective therapies for stroke patients; its treatment is even more difficult considering the unexpected onset of the disease. In the last decade, melatonin has emerged as a promising neuroprotective agent which is able to cross the blood-brain-barrier (BBB) and with a low toxicity profile. The aim of this systematic review was to summarize and critically review clinical and pre-clinical evidence related to melatonin's effectiveness as a stroke treatment. Together with a comparative dose extrapolation with those used in the selected randomized controlled trials (RCTs), and based on these data to discuss whether the administered doses correlate with those advisable in human patients. To address this purpose, we performed a systematic review of the available literature. A total of 529 records were screened with the selecting of six full articles containing RCTs that met the inclusion/exclusion criteria. The evidence drawn from these six reports was analyzed to identify remaining gaps, treatment efficacy, and to suggest future directions. The primary outcome reported was the reduction of the oxidative response; the secondary outcome was the increase of the survival rate of the patients in the intervention groups. Calculations derived from animal studies revealed that the translational doses to humans were substantially higher than those employed in the RCTs. The findings of this systematic review revealed that there are insufficient RCTs to prove melatonin's value in stroke patients. Nevertheless, the evidence is promising, and further clinical research may support the benefits of melatonin in stroke patients, if the adequate dose is administered.",0

The search for a medication that could reduce risk of serious disease, and ideally of any manifestation of disease from SARS-CoV2, and of asymptomatic shedding of SARS-CoV2 is of urgent interest. Repurposing existing pharmaceuticals is among the approaches to achieve these ends. We performed a systematic review of all interventional studies registered in ClinicalTrials.gov with a focus on one repurposed drug, Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ). The detailed analysis of these studies, some of them already recruiting, provide an overall picture of HCQ use as a COVID-19 prophylaxis around the world. Among the included studies, all but three were randomized and parallel and most of them (74%, 23/31) were double-blinded to quadruple-blinded studies. We found a great diversity in dosing and nearly all the possible scientifically reasonable regimens are under evaluation. This diversity offers benefits as well as challenges. Importantly, the final analysis of these trials should be done through an extensive reading of the results in regard to the clinical design, it will be crucial to carefully read and evaluate the results of each study in regards to the clinical design rather than quickly glancing a 140 characters-based social media message announcing the failure or success of a drug against a disease.",0

https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph17082952,A Matter of Degrees: A Systematic Review of the Ergogenic Effect of Pre-Cooling in Highly Trained Athletes,"The current systematic review evaluated the effects of different pre-cooling techniques on sports performance in highly-trained athletes under high temperature conditions. PubMed/MEDLINE, EMBASE, Web of Science, CENTRAL, Scopus, and SPORTDiscus databases were searched from inception to December 2019. Studies performing pre-cooling interventions in non-acclimatized highly-trained athletes (&gt;55 mL/kg/min of maximal oxygen consumption) under heat conditions (≥30 °C) were included. The searched reported 26 articles. Pre-cooling techniques can be external (exposure to ice water, cold packs, or cooling clothes), internal (intake of cold water or ice), or mixed. Cooling prior to exercise concluded increases in distance covered (1.5–13.1%), mean power output (0.9–6.9%), time to exhaustion (19–31.9%), work (0.1–8.5%), and mean peak torque (10.4–22.6%), as well as reductions in completion time (0.6–6.5%). Mixed strategies followed by cold water immersion seem to be the most effective techniques, being directly related with the duration of cooling and showing the major effects in prolonged exercise protocols. The present review showed that pre-cooling methods are an effective strategy to increase sports performance in hot environments. This improvement is associated with the body surface exposed and its sensibility, as well as the time of application, obtaining the best results in prolonged physical exercise protocols.",0

The gut microbiota plays a key role in disease pathogenesis.A systematic review and meta-analysis on case-control studies was conducted to determine whether there is gut microbial dysbiosis in participants with IBS in comparison with healthy controls and, if so, whether the dysbiosis pattern differs among IBS subtypes and geographic regions.This review was conducted and reported according to the MOOSE (Meta-Analysis of Observational Studies in Epidemiology) 2000 and PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) 2009 guidelines. Research articles published up to May 9, 2018 were identified through MEDLINE (PubMed), Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (Cochrane Library), ClinicalTrials.gov, EMBASE, and Web of Science. Study quality was assessed using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale. Case-control studies of participants with IBS who had undergone quantitative gut microbial stool analysis were included. The primary exposure measure of interest is log10 bacterial counts per gram of stool. Meta-analyses were performed to estimate the mean difference (MD) in gut microbiota between participants with IBS and healthy controls using the random-effects model with inverse variance in Revman 5.3 and R 3.5.1. Publication bias was assessed with funnel plots and Egger's test. Between-study heterogeneity was analyzed using Higgins I2 statistic with 95% CIs.There were 6,333 unique articles identified; 52 qualified for full-text screening. Of these, 23 studies were included for analysis (n=1,340 participants from North America, Europe, and Asia). Overall, the studies were moderate in quality. Comparing participants with IBS to healthy controls, lower fecal Lactobacillus (MD= -0.57 log10 colony-forming unit [CFU]/g; P<0.01) and Bifidobacterium (MD= -1.04 log10CFU/g; P<0.01), higher Escherichia coli (MD=0.60 log10CFU/g; P<0.01), and marginally higher Enterobacter (MD=0.74 log10CFU/g; P=0.05). No difference was found between participants with IBS and healthy controls in fecal Bacteroides and Enterococcus (P=0.18 and 0.68, respectively). Publication bias was not observed except in Bifidobacterium (P=0.015). Subgroup analyses on participants with diarrhea-predominant and constipation-predominant IBS showed consistent results with the primary results. A subgroup analysis of Chinese studies was consistent with the primary results, except for fecal Bacteroides, which was increased in participants with IBS vs healthy controls (MD=0.29; 95% CI 0.13 to 0.46; P<0.01). Although substantial heterogeneity was detected (I2>75%) in most comparisons, the direction of the effect estimates is relatively consistent across studies.IBS is characterized by gut microbial dysbiosis. Prospective, large-scale studies are needed to delineate how gut microbial profiles can be used to guide targeted therapies in this challenging patient population.",0
https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jbspin.2020.02.001,Dupuytren's Disease and exposure to vibration: Systematic review and Meta-analysis,"Abstract Introduction Dupuytren's Disease (DD) occurs frequently in the entire population. Several risk factors are well known, including diabetes, alcohol, and age. In this meta-analysis, we assessed the role of occupational vibration exposure in the risk of DD, an issue currently under debate. Methods We searched PubMed, Google Scholar, and the Cochrane Library to find references up to June 2019. DD prevalence was calculated using meta-proportion analysis. Differences in characteristics between DD patients and controls were expressed as standardized mean differences using the inverse of variance method or percentages using also meta-proportion analysis. We performed meta-regression analyses to assess the effects of alcohol, smoking, age, and sex on the DD incidence for the patients with DD that were exposed to vibrations. Results We included 9 studies, comprising a total of 60,570 patients, including 1,804 DD patients. Prevalence of DD was 9.8% (95%CI: 5.9–14.4%). Compared with controls, patients with DD were older, more diabetic, more smokers and with a higher consumption of alcohol. Meta-analysis of the nine longitudinal studies comparing DD occurrence between patients exposed to vibration (626 of 6825) or not (1220 of 52,502) revealed a significantly increased DD incidence among patients with vibration exposure compared with controls (OR = 2.87; 95%CI: 1.41–5.84). In metaregression we found no significant influence of all parameters on DD. Conclusion Age and environmental factors had no effect on DD prevalence among patients exposed to vibrations, despite a 10% prevalence in this group. Using vibration tools at work should be recognized as an important risk factor of developing DD.",0

This branch of technology has been incorporated into various fields of dentistry ranging from diagnosis to prevention and treatment. The latter involves application of numerous biomaterials that help in restoration of esthetic and functional dentition. Over the past decade, these materials were modified through the incorporation of metal nanoparticles (NP) like silver (Ag), gold (Au), titanium (Ti), zinc (Zn), copper (Cu), and zirconia (Zr). They enhanced antimicrobial, mechanical, and regenerative properties of these materials. However, lately, the toxicological implications of these nanometal particles have been realized. They were associated with cytotoxicity, genotoxicity altered inflammatory processes, and reticuloendothelial system toxicity. As dental biomaterials containing metal NPs remain functional in oral cavity over prolonged periods, it is important to know their toxicological effects in humans. With this background, the present systematic review is aimed to gain an insight into the plausible applications and toxic implications of nano-metal particles as related to dentistry.",0

An assessment of pedicle breach was performed independently and in duplicate based on a modification of the Belmont grading scale. Articles for the SR were identified from a structured search of Medline from inception to May 8, 2019, without restriction of language.A total of 82 pedicle screws were placed in 20 patients who underwent surgery between January and June 2014. There was no significant difference in mean operative time between the cases included in this study and a matched cohort of 20 patients undergoing surgery with 2-dimensional fluoroscopy and K-wire-assisted pedicle screw placement (95 ± 13 vs. 87 ± 20 minutes, respectively; P > 0.05). There were 2 major pedicle breaches (Belmont grade 3) in a single patient, yielding a major breach rate of 2.44%. A total of 6 papers that described the placement of 700 pedicle screws in 160 patients between May 2011 and March 2017 were included in the SR. The overall breach rate was 7.00% (n = 37).Percutaneous pedicle screws can be placed accurately and safely using 3-dimensional navigation without the use of K-wires and may confer benefits to patients and clinicians by reducing K-wire-associated complications and radiation exposure.",0

To synthesise this emerging literature, we conducted a systematic review of applications of social vulnerability and resilience frameworks in Lower and Middle Income Countries (LMICs) using the PRISMA methodology. 2152 papers were extracted from 15 databases and then screened according to our pre-defined criteria, leaving 68 studies for full text analysis. Our analysis revealed that: (1) Most studies consider vulnerability or resilience to be generic properties of social systems; (2) Few papers measured vulnerability or resilience in a way that tests whether they are relatively stable or dynamic features of social systems; (3) Many applications rely on stock applications of existing frameworks, with little adaptation to specific cultural, societal or economic contexts; (4) There is a lack of systematic validation; (5) More hypothesis-driven studies (as opposed to descriptive mapping exercises) are required in order to develop a better understanding of the mechanisms through which vulnerability and resilience shape the capacity to prepare for, respond and recover from disasters.",0

The current review examined the differences in offspring’s bone mineral density (BMD) between mothers smoked during pregnancy and those who did not. A systematic review and meta-analysis on the studies investigating the influence of maternal smoking during pregnancy on children or neonates’ bone measures published up to October 30, 2018, was performed. BMD results measured at different body sites were pooled and then fixed or random effect models were used based on the presence of heterogeneity. The desired pooled effect size was the offspring’s BMD mean difference with 95% confidence interval between smoker and non-smoker mothers. Sensitivity analysis was performed for birth weight and current weight, two important mediator/confounders causing heterogeneity. Overall, eight studies consisting of 17,931 participants aged from infancy to 18 years were included. According to the fixed effect model, the mean of BMD in offspring whose mothers smoked during pregnancy was 0.01 g/cm2 lower than those with non-smoker mothers (95% CI = − 0.02 to − 0.002). However, subgroup meta-analysis adjusted for birth weight and current weight demonstrated no significant mean difference between BMD of children with smoker and non-smoker mothers (d = 0.06, 95% CI = −0.04 to 0.16, p value = 0.25 and d = − 0.005, 95% CI = − 0.01 to 0.004, p value = 0.28, respectively). According to available studies, it is suggested that maternal smoking during pregnancy does not have direct effect on the offspring’s BMD. Instead, this association might be confounded by other factors such as placental weight, birth weight, and current body size of children.",0

This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to ascertain the association between mortality and the use of allopurinol in patients with gout.Medline, Embase, CINAHL, and the Cochrane Library were searched from inception to August 2018. Articles eligible for inclusion used a cohort design and examined cardiovascular or all-cause mortality in patients diagnosed with gout and prescribed allopurinol. Information on study characteristics, design, sample size, and mortality risk estimates were extracted. Article quality was assessed using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale. Included articles were described in a narrative synthesis and, where possible, risk estimate data were pooled.Four articles reported a hazard ratio (HR) risk estimate for all-cause mortality in patients with gout using allopurinol, and 2 of these also reported cardiovascular mortality. Two articles found allopurinol to be protective in patients with gout, 1 found no statistically significant association, and 1 found no statistically significant effect of escalation of allopurinol dosage on all-cause or cardiovascular-related mortality. Data pooling was possible for all-cause mortality and found no association between allopurinol use in patients with gout and all-cause mortality compared to patients with gout not using allopurinol (adjusted HR 0.80 [95% confidence interval 0.60-1.05]).There was no significant association between all-cause mortality and allopurinol use in people with gout. However, the number of included studies was small, suggesting that further studies are needed.",0
https://doi.org/10.1007/s00455-020-10103-4,A Systematic Review of the Influence of Bolus Characteristics on Respiratory Measures in Healthy Swallowing,"There have been a number of studies on the effect of bolus volume, consistency, texture, temperature and taste on the oropharyngeal swallowing physiology. However, its influence on the respiratory function associated with swallow is not well understood. This study aimed at systematically analysing and documenting the prevailing research literature on respiratory functions before, during, and after healthy swallows of boluses with varied characteristics. The PRISMA guidelines were followed for retrieval of relevant research. From among the 48,329 reports screened for inclusion criteria, 25 articles were included for data extraction. Each of these reports was evaluated for its design, methodology and reporting quality and also the level of evidence provided by them. The results revealed that the scientific evidence in this regard was restricted to level II. Majority of the studies included considered bolus volume as the variable than bolus consistency, taste or temperature. Expiratory phase was preferred surrounding the apnea irrespective of volume, consistency or taste but changed with temperature variations across age groups. The reports are equivocal on the duration of respiratory apnea, and length of respiratory cycles before and after the apnea. The temporal coordination of pharyngeal swallow events was found to be independent of bolus volume. This review concluded that bolus characteristics have differential effects on the respiratory functions during swallow beyond a 'central sensory threshold' level. Objective standardization of bolus characteristics may be the immediate requirement for generalization of future research findings in this direction.",0
https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jtho.2020.03.002,NSCLC Immunotherapy Efficacy and Antibiotic Use: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis,"Abstract Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) have dramatically improved patient outcomes in a variety of tumor types, but with variable efficacy. Recent research has suggested that antibiotic-induced disruption of the microbiota may impact ICI efficacy. We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of studies that assessed the impact of antibiotic use on the survival of patients diagnosed with NSCLC and treated with ICI. We systematically searched Medline, the Cochrane Library, and major oncology conferences proceedings. Eligible studies mentioned hazard ratio or Kaplan–Meier curves for progression-free survival (PFS) or overall survival (OS) based on antibiotic exposure before or during ICI treatment. We identified 23 eligible studies. The impact of antibiotics was then evaluated in 2208 patients for PFS and 5560 for OS. For both PFS and OS meta-analyses, the between-study heterogeneity was high (Higgins and Thompson I2 of 69% and 80%, respectively). The pooled hazard ratio was 1.47 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.13–1.90) for PFS and 1.69 (95% CI: 1.25–2.29) for OS revealing a significantly reduced survival in patients with NSCLC exposed to antibiotics. The median OS was reduced on average by 6.7 months (95% CI: 5.1–8.4) in the patients exposed to antibiotics. The effect seems to depend on the time window of exposure with stronger effects reported when the patients took antibiotics [−60 days; +60 days] around ICI initiation. In patients with NSCLC, the findings of the meta-analysis indicate that antibiotic use before or during treatment with ICI leads to a median OS decreased by more than 6 months. Specifically, exposure shortly before or after ICI initiation seems to be particularly detrimental, whereas antibiotic use later during disease course does not seem to alter survival. Because PFS and OS were difficult to compare between studies owing to heterogeneity and the multiple confounding factors identified, further studies are needed to strengthen the understanding of this phenomenon.",0
https://doi.org/10.1016/j.sapharm.2019.12.009,Access to medicines - a systematic review of the literature,"Abstract Background Budgetary constraints and the rising cost of new innovative medicines are the key challenges for access to medicines. Multiple research studies explored diverse dimensions of this topic, however, a thorough and detailed review of existing literature on access to medicines in United Kingdom is lacking. Therefore, the objective of this systematic review of literature was to critically review and analyse the literature pertaining to original research on access to medicines issue in the United Kingdom. This review includes two types of studies: (a) UK centric studies (b) studies comparing UK with the other countries. Methods A systematic search of articles published between Jan 2008 and October 12, 2018 was conducted according to PRISMA guidelines using the following databases: PubMed, Scopus, Science Direct, and specific journals including BMJ, Lancet, Value in Health, Pharmacoeconomics, Pharmacoeconomics Open, Journal of pharmaceutical policy and practice, Health Policy. Results The searches across all databases and journals resulted in 53 relevant articles. The data extracted from the 53 articles generated key themes. These themes included: Access to Medicines, Health technology assessment (HTA), Pricing and Health technology assessment, Risk Sharing Agreements & Stakeholders involvement/views on reimbursement Process. Subthemes were added under the key themes where applicable. Conclusions This review systematically evaluated the current literature and identified variability in access to medicines across countries in UK &EU and across different categories of medicines. Medicine licensing and reimbursement environment is continuously evolving and there are challenges as well as opportunities for learning and collaboration among countries which are at different stages of advancement in their systems.",0
https://doi.org/10.1002/cam4.3095,Quality of adverse event reporting in phase III randomized controlled trials of breast and colorectal cancer: A systematic review,"Background Clinical trial reports often emphasize efficacy over harms, leading to misinterpretation of the risk-to-benefit ratio of new therapies. Clear and sufficiently detailed reporting of methods and results is especially important in the abstracts of trial reports, as readers often base their assessment of a trial on such information. In this study, we evaluated the quality of adverse event (AE) reporting and abstract quality in phase III randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of systemic therapies in breast and colorectal cancer. Methods Medline, EMBASE, Cochrane Database of RCTs, and Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews were searched from November 2005 to September 2018. Phase III RCTs evaluating systemic therapies in breast or colorectal cancer were included. Each article was independently reviewed by two investigators using a standardized data extraction form based on guidelines developed by the Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials (CONSORT) group. Descriptive statistics, bivariate analysis, and multivariable linear regression were used to analyze data. All statistical tests were two-sided. Results Of 166 RCTs identified, 99.4% reported harms in the manuscript body, and 59.6% reported harms in the abstract. Reporting was restricted to severe harms in 15.6% of RCTs. Statistical comparison of AE rates went unreported in 59.0% of studies. Information regarding AEs leading to dose reductions, treatment discontinuations, or study withdrawals went unreported in 59.3%, 18.7%, and 86.8% of studies, respectively. Recently published RCTs (P = .009) and those sponsored at least partially by for-profit companies (P = .003) had higher abstract quality scores. Conclusions Breast and colorectal cancer phase III RCTs inadequately report CONSORT-compliant AE data. Improved guideline adherence and abstract reporting is required to properly weigh benefits and harms of new oncologic therapies. Systematic Review Registration Number CRD42019140673.",0

Weighted random effects meta-analyses were conducted using the DerSimonian and Laird method. Wald-type tests were used to compare treatment modalities for each outcome, where the null hypothesis was rejected for p < 0.05.Seven studies were included that consisted of 6795 patients (2849 CFRT, 3357 HFRT, and 589 UHRT). Median age was 68 years. Summary effect sizes for 5-year DFS were 85.1% (95% CI: 82.1%-87.8%) for CFRT, 86% (95% CI: 83%-88.7%) for HFRT, and 85% (95% CI: 80%-87%) for UHRT (p = 0.66 and p = 0.8 for CFRT vs. HFRT and CFRT versus UHRT, respectively). Summary effect sizes for late grade 2+ gastrointestinal toxicity were 12.1% (95% CI: 9.2%-15.4%) for CFRT, 14.6% (95% CI: 9.9%-20%) for HFRT, and 10% (95% CI: 7%-13%) for UHRT (p = 0.41 and p = 0.09 for CFRT versus HFRT and CFRT versusus UHRT, respectively). Summary effect sizes for late grade 2+ genitourinary toxicity were 19.4% (95% CI: 10.7-29.9%) for CFRT, 20.4% (95% CI: 10.2%-32.9%) for HFRT, and 18% (95% CI: 15%-22%) for UHRT (p = 0.89 and p = 0.92 for CFRT versus HFRT and CFRT versus UHRT, respectively).Ultrahypofrationated regimens appear to offer similar levels of safety and efficacy to CFRT and HFRT. These findings are hypothesis-generating and require further validation by ongoing prospective trials.",0

Amongst healthcare workers, nurses are known to struggle with burnout symptoms the most, carrying serious consequences for patients, other healthcare professionals and healthcare organisations. Evidence has suggested that burnout symptoms in nurses is high across specialties and countries, but no meta-analysis have been performed to investigate burnout symptoms prevalence in nurses globally. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to examine burnout symptoms prevalence in nurses worldwide using 8 academic research databases. Risk of bias, heterogeneity and subgroup analyses were further conducted in the meta-analysis. 113 studies were included for systematic review and 61 studies for the meta-analysis, consisting 45,539 nurses worldwide in 49 countries across multiple specialties. An overall pooled-prevalence of burnout symptoms among global nurses was 11.23%. Significant differences were noted between geographical regions, specialties and type of burnout measurement used. Sub-Saharan African region had the highest burnout symptoms prevalence rate while Europe and Central Asia region had the lowest. Paediatric nurses had the highest burnout symptoms prevalence rates among all specialties while Geriatric care nurses had the lowest. This study is the first study to synthesize published studies and to estimate pooled-prevalence of burnout symptoms among nurses globally. The findings suggest that nurses have high burnout symptoms prevalence warranting attention and implementation. This study serves as an impetus for intervention studies and policy change to improve nurses' work conditions and overall healthcare quality.",0
https://doi.org/10.1080/09546634.2020.1770173,Ventilatory support in Stevens-Johnson syndrome and toxic epidermal necrolysis: a systematic review and meta-analysis,"Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS) and Toxic Epidermal Necrolysis (TEN) are blistering cutaneous disorders that often manifest with epidermal and mucosal necrosis. In extreme cases, the upper or bronchial airways are threatened, necessitating intubation and mechanical ventilation. This systematic review and meta-analysis examines the prevalence of mechanical ventilation (MV) in patients with SJS or TENS, despite maximal medical therapy, and additionally aims to identify the risk factors associated with this requirement.A systematic review of the literature was performed using the PRISMA guidelines and meta-analysis of proportions.Six articles were included, with pooled total of 18648 cases. The weighted prevalence of MV was 27.5% (95%CI 17.8-39.9%). The need for MV was more closely associated with TEN, compared to SJS (OR 4.40, 95%CI 2.73-7.10, I2=48%, p<.00001.) Risk factors associated with the need for MV included bacteremia (OR 5.02, 95%CI 2.87-8.79, I2=0%, p<.00001), shock/organ failure on admission (OR 261.99, 95%CI 21.88-3137, I2=71, p<.0001), total body surface area (TBSA) >30% (OR 4.47, 95%CI 1.41-14.20, I2=71, p=.01.).Limited published evidence with significant heterogeneity exists within the literature regarding the need for MV in SJS and TEN. Greater cutaneous involvement, and more critically unwell patients appear more likely to require MV.",0
https://doi.org/10.1016/j.sleh.2020.03.008,The association between exposure to second-hand smoke and sleep disturbances: A systematic review and meta-analysis,"Abstract Objective To investigate the association between second-hand smoke (SHS) exposure and sleep disturbances by systematically reviewing the literature base and to quantify this association by conducting a meta-analysis. Method We did a systematic search of five databases- PubMed, Embase, CINAHL Plus, Web of Science - Core Collection, and Google Scholar. The primary outcomes were short sleep duration (SSD), poor sleep quality (PSQ), and excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS). Result Our systematic search yielded a total of 1623 studies. However, 12 studies qualified for qualitative synthesis and 11 studies (12 surveys) with adequate information were included in the meta-analysis involving 730,808 participants. All the studies were cross-sectional. We found an association between SHS exposure and SSD [pooled OR: 1.20 (95% CI, 1.09–1.33; p = 0.0003; I2= 68%), N = 7]; EDS [pooled OR: 1.07 (95% CI, 1.01–1.13; p = 0.02; I2 = 0%), N = 4]; and PSQ [pooled OR: 1.12 (95% CI, 1.01–1.23; p = 0.03; I2 = 79%), N = 10]. Subgroup analyses suggest significant association between SHS exposure and PSQ among adolescents. However, no such association was observed among adults. In addition, no significant association was observed between PSQ and SHS exposure when biomarker was used to identify SHS exposure. Conclusion This study is the first systematic review and meta-analysis to examine the association between SHS exposure and sleep outcomes. Self-reported exposure to SHS is positively associated with SSD, EDS, and PSQ, although the effects are modest. Further studies with robust methodology to ascertain exposure information are warranted to further elucidate the relationship between SHS exposure and sleep disturbances.",1

Studies evaluating this association have reached divergent conclusions. We aimed to evaluate this proposed association further and to assess the quality of the evidence in its support. Methods We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, ISI Web of Science, and Cochrane databases for studies examining a link between PPI use and dementia, up to February 2019. Studies reporting summary results as hazard ratio (HR) or odds ratio (OR) were pooled using the DerSimonian and Laird random-effects model for meta-analyses. Methodological quality of individual observational studies was assessed using the Newcastle-Ottawa scale and the overall quality of evidence rated as per the GRADE approach. Results We identified and included 11 observational studies comprising 642,949 subjects; 64% were women. Most studies were short-term ranging from 5 to 10 years. There were 158,954 PPI users and 483,995 nonusers. For studies summarizing data as adjusted HR, pooled HR for all causes of dementia was 1.10 (0.88-1.37); for Alzheimer dementia only, it was 1.06 (0.72-1.55). For studies summarizing data as adjusted OR, pooled OR for all causes of dementia was 1.03 (0.84-1.25) and for Alzheimer dementia only 0.96 (0.82-1.11). Per Newcastle-Ottawa scale assessment, 10 studies were of high quality and 1 was of moderate quality. By applying GRADE methodology, quality of evidence for both outcomes was very low. Discussion We found no evidence to support the proposed association between PPI use and an increased risk of dementia. PPI use among patients who have a valid indication for it, should not be curtailed because of concerns about dementia risk.",0

Methods: Systematic review with meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of behavioral interventions for smoking cessation, with or without stop-smoking medication. We searched the Cochrane Tobacco Addiction Group Specialized Register for RCTs with objective outcomes measured at ≥ 6 months. Study authors were contacted to obtain comprehensive descriptions of their comparator interventions. Meta-regression analyses examined the relationships of smoking cessation rates with stop-smoking medication and behavior change techniques. Results: One hundred and four of 142 eligible comparator groups (n = 23 706) had complete data and were included in analyses. There was considerable variability in the number of behavior change techniques delivered [mean = 15.97, standard deviation (SD) = 13.54, range = 0–45] and the provision of smoking cessation medication (43% of groups received medication) throughout and within categories of comparator groups (e.g. usual care, brief advice). Higher smoking cessation rates were predicted by provision of medication [B = 0.334, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.030–0.638, P = 0.031] and number of behavior change techniques included (B = 0.020, 95% CI = 0.008–0.032, P < 0.001). Modelled cessation rates in comparator groups that received the most intensive support were 15 percentage points higher than those that received the least (23 versus 8%). Conclusions: Interventions delivered to comparator groups in smoking cessation randomized controlled trials vary considerably in content, and cessation rates are strongly predicted by stop-smoking medication and number of behavior change techniques delivered.",0

While both tenofovir disoproxil (TDF) and entecavir (ETV) have been shown to reduce the risk of HCC, their comparative effectiveness is unclear. We estimated the comparative effectiveness of these two agents in reducing the risk of HCC in patients with CHB, through a systematic review and meta-analysis.We searched multiple electronic databases from January 1, 1998, to October 31, 2019, for randomized controlled trials and observational comparative effectiveness studies in adults with CHB treated with ETV compared to TDF, reporting the incidence of HCC (minimum follow-up 12 months). Primary outcome was incidence of HCC, calculated as incidence rate ratio (IRR) with 95% confidence interval (CI, unadjusted analysis) and hazard ratio (HR) with 95% CI (adjusted analysis, where reported). Of 1,971 records identified, 14 studies (263,947 person-years) were included for quantitative analysis. On unadjusted meta-analysis of 14 studies, the risk of HCC was not statistically different between ETV and TDF (IRR, 1.28; 95% CI, 0.99-1.66). When using available adjusted data (multivariate or propensity-matched data), the risk of HCC among patients treated with ETV was 27% higher when compared to TDF (seven studies; 95% CI, 1.01-1.60, P = 0.04). Additional analysis of adjusted data when separately reported among patients with cirrhosis demonstrated an adjusted HR of 0.90 (95% CI, 0.66-1.23), suggesting no difference between ETV-treated and TDF-treated groups. The overall confidence in estimates was very low (observational studies, high heterogeneity).TDF may be associated with lower risk of HCC when compared to ETV.",0
https://doi.org/10.1111/vco.12581,"Histologically low‐grade, yet biologically high‐grade, canine cutaneous mast cell tumours: A systematic review and meta‐analysis of individual participant data","Low-grade canine cutaneous mast cell tumour (cMCT) with metastasis at the time of treatment is uncommonly reported, with few studies focusing on this specific clinical entity. The specific objective of this study was to systematically review the veterinary literature and perform a meta-analysis summarizing the clinical presentation, treatments reported and clinical outcomes from dogs with histologically low-grade cMCT and metastasis present at initial treatment. A total of 980 studies were screened with eight publications providing data on 121 dogs ultimately included. The most common treatments were surgery with adjuvant chemotherapy in 83/121 (69%) dogs; combined surgery, radiation and chemotherapy in 17/121 (14%) dogs; chemotherapy alone in 12/121 (10%) dogs and surgery alone in 7/121 (6%) dogs. Dogs with distant metastasis (n = 22) experienced significantly shorter survival compared with those with regional lymph node (RLN) metastasis (n = 99; median 194 vs 637 days; P < .01). Two variables were significantly associated with increased risk of death: presence of distant (vs RLN) metastasis (hazard ratio = 2.60; P < .01) and not receiving surgery as a component of treatment (hazard ratio = 3.79; P < .01). Risk of bias was judged to be low in terms of selection and performance bias but high in terms of detection and exclusion bias. In conclusion, dogs with cMCT and RLN metastasis can be expected to live significantly longer than those with distant metastasis, and surgery appears to have a role in extending survival of metastatic low-grade cMCT.",0
https://doi.org/10.20524/aog.2020.0483,Use of proton pump inhibitors is associated with a higher risk of pneumonia in cirrhotic patients: a systematic review and meta-analysis,"Proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) are commonly prescribed for cirrhotic patients. However, the use of PPIs in these patients may increase the risk of bacterial infection. The current study aimed to investigate the risk of developing pneumonia among cirrhotic patients exposed to PPIs.A literature search was independently conducted by 2 investigators using the MEDLINE and EMBASE databases up to September 2019. To be eligible, a study had to be an observational (cohort, case-control or cross-sectional) study that included one group of cirrhotic patients with PPI use and another group of cirrhotic patients without PPI use. Effect estimates of the association between PPI use and pneumonia had to be reported. Point estimates and standard errors from each eligible study were combined together using the generic inverse variance method of DerSimonian and Laird.Of 1947 articles identified from the 2 databases, 3 cohort and 5 cross-sectional studies with 40,295 participants met the eligibility criteria and were included in the meta-analysis. The pooled analysis found that cirrhotic patients with a history of PPI use had a significantly higher risk of developing pneumonia than those without PPI use, with a pooled risk ratio of 1.36 (95% confidence interval 1.00-1.85; I2 47%).A significantly increased risk of pneumonia among cirrhotic patients exposed to PPIs was demonstrated in this study.",0
https://doi.org/10.3390/pathogens9040266,A Systematic Review: Is Aedes albopictus an Efficient Bridge Vector for Zoonotic Arboviruses?,"Mosquito-borne arboviruses are increasing due to human disturbances of natural ecosystems and globalization of trade and travel. These anthropic changes may affect mosquito communities by modulating ecological traits that influence the “spill-over” dynamics of zoonotic pathogens, especially at the interface between natural and human environments. Particularly, the global invasion of Aedes albopictus is observed not only across urban and peri-urban settings, but also in newly invaded areas in natural settings. This could foster the interaction of Ae. albopictus with wildlife, including local reservoirs of enzootic arboviruses, with implications for the potential zoonotic transfer of pathogens. To evaluate the potential of Ae. albopictus as a bridge vector of arboviruses between wildlife and humans, we performed a bibliographic search and analysis focusing on three components: (1) The capacity of Ae. albopictus to exploit natural larval breeding sites, (2) the blood-feeding behaviour of Ae. albopictus, and (3) Ae. albopictus’ vector competence for arboviruses. Our analysis confirms the potential of Ae. albopictus as a bridge vector based on its colonization of natural breeding sites in newly invaded areas, its opportunistic feeding behaviour together with the preference for human blood, and the competence to transmit 14 arboviruses.",0

Cognitively, it impairs cognitive functioning and decision making. Behaviorally, air pollution triggers avoidance behavior, defensive expenditure, and migration as coping strategies. Economically, it hurts work productivity and stock markets. Socially, it exacerbates criminal activities and worsens perception of the government. Importantly, both actual and perceived air pollution levels matter. Limitations of past research and future directions are discussed.",0

The meta-analysis established a comparison of the curative effect of two adjuvant endocrine therapies. In order to obtain randomized controlled trials (RCTs) related to this metaanalysis, PubMed and Embase database were searched systematically in English during May 2019. Two reviewers screened the articles and extracted data based on the criteria recommended by the Cochrane collaboration for evaluating evidence in RCTs. The first outcome was disease-free survival (DFS). Overall survival (OS) was the other endpoint. Hazard ratios (HRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were pooled utilizing fixed-effect model. The heterogeneity of this study has been described by Cochran's Q and the I2 statistics. Three RCTs which involved 7,203 premenopausal women with breast cancer were available in this meta-analysis. Pooled HRs showed that there was not difference between AIs plus OFS and TAM plus OFS in DFS (HR =0.87, 95% CI: 0.66-1.14, P=0.30). No statistical differences were found in OS between the two adjuvant therapies (HR =1.22, 95% CI: 0.75-1.99, P=0.43). Based on the included studies, there were no statistical differences between AIs plus OFS and TAM plus OFS in DFS and OS.",0

A systematic review,"Introduction Neuroplasticity is harnessed through high-intensity or high-dose training. Given the costs and time burden for families of children with cerebral palsy (CP), it is important to quantify which rehabilitation training approaches and doses confer the largest clinical gain. The main objective of this systematic review was to determine any threshold dose of upper limb training needed for children with CP to achieve clinically significant functional improvements.Methods This systematic review included studies if they were as follows: randomised controlled trials; participants had a diagnosis of CP or brain injury; mean age of participants was 0-18 years; and intervention was an active upper limb training intervention. Two raters independently extracted data. Data were pooled and analysed using a receiver operator characteristic (ROC) curve and odds ratios to investigate the dose of practice that led to clinically significant gains.Results A total of 74 trials were included in this review. Quantitative analyses included 25 studies (707 participants; age range 18 months to 21 years) for motor function (Assisting Hand Assessment) and 20 studies (491 participants; age range 3 months to 17 years) for individual goal achievement (Canadian Occupational Performance Measure). ROC curve analyses found that approximately 40 hr of practice is needed to improve upper limb motor ability in the unilateral population. For all typographies of CP, individual goals were achieved at a lower dose (14-25 hr) of practice when goal-directed interventions were provided.Conclusion To improve individual goals, children need to practice goals for more than 14-25 hr, combining face-to-face therapy with home practice. To improve general upper limb function (based on evidence in the unilateral population), children need to practice for more than 30-40 hr. Interventions that set functional goals and involve actual practice of those goals lead to goal achievement at a lower dose than general upper limb motor training.",0
https://doi.org/10.3390/bs10050083,Hidden Realities of Infant Feeding: Systematic Review of Qualitative Findings from Parents,"A growing, global conversation, regarding realities and challenges that parents experience today is ever-present. To understand recent parent’s attitudes, beliefs, and perceptions regarding infant feeding, we sought to systematically identify and synthesize original qualitative research findings. Following the Enhancing Transparency in Reporting the Synthesis of Qualitative Research (ENTREQ) framework, electronic databases were searched with a priori terms applied to title/abstract fields and limited to studies published in English from 2015 to 2019, inclusive. Study quality assessment was conducted using the Critical Appraisal Skills Programme (CASP) checklist, and thematic analyses performed. Of 73 studies meeting inclusion criteria, four major themes emerged. (1) Breastfeeding is best for an infant; (2) Distinct attitudes, beliefs, and perceptions of mothers that breastfeed, and those that could not or chose not to breastfeed, are evident; (3) Infant feeding behaviors are influenced by the socio-cultural environment of the family, and (4) Parent’s expectations of education and support addressing personal infant feeding choices from health care providers are not always met. This systematic review, guided by constructs within behavioral models and theories, provides updated findings to help inform the development of nutrition education curricula and public policy programs. Results can be applied within scale-up nutrition and behavioral education interventions that support parents during infant feeding.",0
https://doi.org/10.1093/pubmed/fdz054,Association of smokeless tobacco and cerebrovascular accident: a systematic review and meta-analysis of global data,"Abstract Background The association of smokeless tobacco (SLT) with stroke has been dealt with in only a few reviews. The present meta-analysis aims to present the updated comprehensive summary risk of stroke in adult SLT users along with sub group analysis. Methods A systematic literature search for articles evaluating risk of stroke in SLT users was conducted. The study characteristics and risk estimates were extracted independently by two authors (RG and SG). Random-effect model was used to estimate the summary relative risks. Results The overall risk of stroke in SLT users was found to be significantly higher (1.17, 95% CI 1.04–1.30) compared to non-users, especially for users in Southeast Asian region. The results remained unchanged even after strict adjustment for smoking (1.18, 95% CI 1.04–1.32). SLT users had 1.34 times or 13.4% higher risk of fatal stroke, though risk of nonfatal stroke was not enhanced. Significantly higher risk of stroke was seen in users of chewing tobacco (1.35, 95% CI 1.20–1.50) in comparison to non-chewers. Gender-based analysis showed enhanced risk of fatal stroke in both male and female users. SLT-attributable fraction of fatal stroke was highest for India at 14.8%. Conclusion The significant higher risk of stroke with SLT use, even after adjustment for smoking, emphasizes the imperative need to include SLT cessation advice for control and prevention of stroke.",0
https://doi.org/10.1111/add.14981,Brief interventions targeting long‐term benzodiazepine and Z‐drug use in primary care: a systematic review and meta‐analysis,"AIMS: To assess the effectiveness of brief interventions in primary care aimed at reducing or discontinuing long-term benzodiazepine/Z-drug (BZRA) use.  METHOD: Systematic review of randomized controlled trials of brief interventions in primary care settings aimed at reducing or discontinuing long-term BZRA use in adults taking BZRAs for ≥ 3 months. Four electronic databases were searched: PubMed, EMBASE, PsycINFO and CENTRAL. The primary outcome was BZRA use, classified as discontinuation or reduction by ≥ 25%. The Theoretical Domains Framework (TDF) was used to retrospectively code behavioural determinants targeted by the interventions. The Behaviour Change Technique (BCT) Taxonomy was used to identify the interventions' active components. Study-specific estimates were pooled, where appropriate, to yield summary risk ratios (RRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Pearson's correlations were used to determine the relationship between intervention effect size and the results of both the TDF and BCT coding.  RESULTS: Eight studies were included (n = 2071 patients). Compared with usual care, intervention patients were more likely to have discontinued BZRA use at 6 months (eight studies, RR = 2.73, 95% CI = 1.84-4.06) and 12 months post-intervention (two studies, RR = 3.41, 95% CI = 2.22-5.25). TDF domains 'knowledge', 'memory, attention and decision processes', 'environmental context and resources' and 'social influences' were identified as having been included in every intervention. Commonly identified BCTs included 'information about health consequences', 'credible source' and 'adding objects to the environment'. There was no detectable relationship between effect size and the results of either the TDF or BCT coding.  CONCLUSION: Brief interventions delivered in primary care are more effective than usual care in reducing and discontinuing long-term benzodiazepine/Z-drug use.",0

Methods We searched MEDLINE, Embase, Cochrane and SCOPUS for studies assessing fetal cardiac function in drug-exposed human pregnancies. Risk of bias was assessed by the Risk Of Bias In Non-randomized Studies of Interventions (ROBIN-I) tool. Results We included 32 studies on eight different drug groups. They included 51 outcome variables, which were all based on ultrasound techniques primarily assessing systolic function: pulsed wave Doppler, tissue Doppler imaging (TDI), and B- and M-mode. Overall, the risk of bias was moderate. β 2 agonists increased the systolic velocity in the ductus arteriosus and the fetal heart rate. β-blockers caused unchanged or decreased systolic velocity of the pulmonary trunk. Corticosteroids increased the velocity in the ductus arteriosus. Furthermore, in growth-restricted fetuses with an increased myocardial performance index (MPI′) on the right side, corticosteroids normalized this variable. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), but not acetylsalicylic acid, increased the flow velocities in the ductus arteriosus, decreased the shortening fraction and increased the end-diastolic ventricular diameters. Metformin and insulin normalized the diastolic strain and global longitudinal strain in diabetic pregnancies. Highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) exposure increased the E/A ratio on the right side, prolonged the isovolumic relaxation time (IRT) and ejection time, shortened the isovolumic contraction time (ICT), and decreased left myocardial systolic peak velocities. Chemotherapy did not cause detectable changes. Conclusion Six of the eight drug groups caused detectable changes in fetal cardiac function. However, the evidence was hampered by only a few studies for some drugs.",0
https://doi.org/10.1037/ocp0000178,Safety training for migrant workers in the construction industry: A systematic review and future research agenda.,"In the construction sector, there is a high risk for accidents, injuries, and fatalities, particularly for migrant workers who comprise a large proportion of the workforce. This article presents a systematic literature review of current safety training provision for migrant construction workers. In the interests of rigor, we draw on the learning, training transfer, and training effectiveness literatures, exploring not only the extent to which training brings about the intended outcomes, in terms of enhanced safety behaviors, and reduced accidents and injuries, but also the factors that influence learning and transfer of training back to the working environment. The literature search revealed only 18 peer-reviewed articles have been published since 2000, which is particularly surprising, given the disproportionate accident and fatality rates for migrant workers. Consequently, we propose a research agenda to enhance safety training for low skilled, migrant and native construction workers, drawing on cognitive and social constructivist instructional design models, which view training as a dynamic process involving active participation of trainees. We advocate the importance of attending to the situational context in which workers are embedded, including labor market conditions, social relations, and cultural differences. Finally, we propose the need for further longitudinal, multidimensional research to evaluate the impact of safety training on learning, transfer of training, and individual- and organizational-level outcomes, such as behavior change, and accident and fatality rates.",0

We aimed to investigate whether exposure to formaldehyde (FA) is associated with asthma, which could provide clues for preventive and mitigation actions. This article provides a systematic review and meta-analysis of observational studies to assess the association between indoor FA exposure and the risk of asthma in children and adults. An electronic search of PubMed, Embase, and Web of Science was performed to collect all relevant studies published before January 1, 2020, and a total of 13 papers were included in this meta-analysis. A random-effect model was conducted to calculate the pooled odds ratio (OR) between FA exposure and asthma. We found that each 10 µg/m3 increase in FA exposure was significantly associated with a 10% increase in the risk of asthma in children (OR = 1.10, 95% confidence interval = 1.00-1.21). We sorted the FA concentrations reported in the selected articles and categorized exposure variables into low (FA ≤ 22.5 µg/m3 ) and high exposure (FA > 22.5 µg/m3 ) according to the median concentration of FA. In the high-exposure adult group, FA exposure may also be associated with an increased risk of asthma (OR = 1.81, 95% CI = 1.18-2.78).",1

Quitting smoking is a proven way of reducing the harm of smoking. Nicotine replacement therapy (NRT), auricular acupressure and acupuncture are used for quit smoking, but it remains to be explored which is relatively more effective. Furthermore, a Bayesian network meta-analysis will be applied to determine the relative effects and/or safety of different smoking cessation treatments. Methods/design A literature search for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) will be performed in five electronic databases from inception to December 2019, including PubMed, the Cochrane library, EMBASE, Web of Science, and Chinese Biomedical Database (SinoMed). Cochrane Collaboration quality assessment tool will be used for the risk of bias assessment. A Bayesian network meta-analysis will be performed using WinBUGS 1.4.3, and Stata 14 will be applied to draw the network diagram, while RevMan 5.3.5 will be used to produce funnel plot for assessing the risk of publication bias. Recommended rating, development and grade methodology will also be utilized to assess the quality of evidence. Results We will evaluate the effect of different smoking cessation treatments (e.g., acupuncture, auricular acupressure, and NRT) by directly traditional meta-analysis and indirectly Bayesian network meta-analysis. Conclusion Our study will provide smokers with the available evidence on the efficacy and safety of quitting regimens.",0

Whether maternal exposure to greenness has an impact on pregnancy complications and pregnancy outcomes remains to be confirmed.To estimate the association and dose-response relationship between residential greenness and pregnancy outcomes.PubMed, Embase, Ovid, Scopus and Web of Science from inception to 1st December 2019 were searched.The summary regression coefficient (β) and odds ratio (OR) with corresponding 95% confidence interval (95%CI) were calculated. The linear dose-response relationship between greenness and adverse pregnancy outcomes was also investigated.Overall, 36 studies with a total of 11,983,089 participants were included. Birth weight was significantly higher in highest level of greenness exposure group compared to lowest level group (e.g. β:20.22, 95%CI:13.50-26.93 at 100 m buffer). The odds of low birth weight (LBW) decreased in the highest level of group compared to lowest level group (e.g. OR:0.86, 95%CI:0.75-0.99 at 100 m buffer). The odds of small for gestational age (SGA) also decreased in the highest group (OR:0.93, 95%CI:0.88-1.00 at 100 m buffer). In addition, maternal exposure to greenness was associated with increased head circumference and decreased mental disorders. The dose-response models showed a 2% decrease risk of LBW per 0.1 normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) increase within 300 m buffer (OR:0.98, 95%CI:0.97-0.99, P < 0.001) and a 1% decrease risk of SGA per 0.1 NDVI increase within 300 m buffer (OR:0.99, 95%CI:0.98-1.00, P = 0.037). No significant associations were found on preterm birth, gestational age, gestational diabetes mellitus, gestational hypertension or preeclampsia.This review confirms an inverse association between residential greenness and adverse pregnancy outcomes. Findings of our study provide evidences for pregnant women to increase greenness exposure.",1
https://doi.org/10.1161/hypertensionaha.120.14993,Blood Pressure and Risks of Cognitive Impairment and Dementia,"Controversies persist regarding the association between blood pressure (BP) and the risks of cognitive impairment and dementia due to inconsistent definitions of BP exposure and varying population characteristics. Here, we searched PubMed and performed a meta-analysis of the influence of BP exposure on the risks of cognitive disorders in prospective studies. Dose-response analyses were performed to illustrate the existence of linear/nonlinear relationships. The credibility of each meta-analysis was evaluated according to the risk of bias, inconsistency, and imprecision. Of the 31 628 citations, 209 were included in our systematic review, among which 136 were eligible for the meta-analysis. Overall, stronger associations were found in midlife than late-life. Moderate-quality evidence indicated that midlife hypertension was related to a 1.19- to 1.55-fold excess risk of cognitive disorders. Dose-response analyses of 5 studies indicated that midlife systolic BP &gt;130 mm Hg was associated with an increased risk of cognitive disorders. With regard to BP exposure in late-life, high systolic BP, low diastolic BP, excessive BP variability, and orthostatic hypotension were all associated with an increased dementia risk. Encouragingly, the use of antihypertensive medications exhibited a 21% reduction in dementia risk. The U-shaped dose-response curve indicated that the protective window of diastolic BP level was between 90 and 100 mm Hg for low risk of Alzheimer disease. The relationships between BP variables and cognitive disorders are age- and BP type-dependent. Antihypertensive medications were associated with a reduced risk of dementia. However, the optimal dose, duration, and type for preventing cognitive disorders warrant further investigation.",0

There should be increased support for MDD and AD diagnosis and treatment in individuals with cardiac diseases, because treatment rates have been low. However, cardiac–psychiatric drug interaction can make pharmacologic treatment challenging. The objective of the present systematic review was to investigate cardiac–psychiatric drug interactions in three different widely used pharmacological databases (Micromedex, Up to Date, and ClinicalKey). Among 4914 cardiac–psychiatric drug combinations, 293 significant interactions were found (6.0%). When a problematic interaction is detected, it may be easier to find an alternative cardiac medication (32.6% presented some interaction) than a psychiatric one (76.9%). Antiarrhythmics are the major class of concern. The most common problems produced by these interactions are related to cardiotoxicity (QT prolongation, torsades de pointes, cardiac arrest), increased exposure of cytochrome P450 2D6 (CYP2D6) substrates, or reduced renal clearance of organic cation transporter 2 (OCT2) substrates and include hypertensive crisis, increased risk of bleeding, myopathy, and/or rhabdomyolysis. Unfortunately, there is considerable inconsistency among the databases searched, such that a clinician’s discretion and clinical experience remain invaluable tools for the management of patients with comorbidities present in psychiatric and cardiac disorders. The possibility of an interaction should be considered. With a multidisciplinary approach, particularly involving a pharmacist, the prescriber should be alerted to the possibility of an interaction. MDD and AD pharmacologic treatment in cardiac patients could be implemented safely both by cardiologists and psychiatrists. PROSPERO Systematic Review Registration Number: CRD42018100424.",0
https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pmed.1003100,Metabolic risk factors and incident advanced liver disease in non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD): A systematic review and meta-analysis of population-based observational studies,"Background Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a leading cause of chronic liver disease worldwide. Many individuals have risk factors associated with NAFLD, but the majority do not develop advanced liver disease: cirrhosis, hepatic decompensation, or hepatocellular carcinoma. Identifying people at high risk of experiencing these complications is important in order to prevent disease progression. This review synthesises the evidence on metabolic risk factors and their potential to predict liver disease outcomes in the general population at risk of NAFLD or with diagnosed NAFLD. Methods and findings We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of population-based cohort studies. Databases (including MEDLINE, EMBASE, the Cochrane Library, and ClinicalTrials.gov) were searched up to 9 January 2020. Studies were included that reported severe liver disease outcomes (defined as liver cirrhosis, complications of cirrhosis, or liver-related death) or advanced fibrosis/non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) in adult individuals with metabolic risk factors, compared with individuals with no metabolic risk factors. Cohorts selected on the basis of a clinically indicated liver biopsy were excluded to better reflect general population risk. Risk of bias was assessed using the QUIPS tool. The results of similar studies were pooled, and overall estimates of hazard ratio (HR) were obtained using random-effects meta-analyses. Of 7,300 unique citations, 22 studies met the inclusion criteria and were of sufficient quality, with 18 studies contributing data suitable for pooling in 2 random-effects meta-analyses. Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) was associated with an increased risk of incident severe liver disease events (adjusted HR 2.25, 95% CI 1.83–2.76, p 30 kg/m2) as a prognostic factor, providing data on 19.3 million individuals followed up for a median of 13.8 years (IQR 9.0 to 19.8) experiencing 49,541 liver events. Obesity was associated with a modest increase in risk of incident severe liver disease outcomes (adjusted HR 1.20, 95% CI 1.12–1.28, p < 0.001, I2 87%). There was also evidence to suggest that lipid abnormalities (low high-density lipoprotein and high triglycerides) and hypertension were both independently associated with incident severe liver disease. Significant study heterogeneity observed in the meta-analyses and possible under-publishing of smaller negative studies are acknowledged to be limitations, as well as the potential effect of competing risks on outcome. Conclusions In this review, we observed that T2DM is associated with a greater than 2-fold increase in the risk of developing severe liver disease. As the incidence of diabetes and obesity continue to rise, using these findings to improve case finding for people at high risk of liver disease will allow for effective management to help address the increasing morbidity and mortality from liver disease.

The objectives of the current systematic review were to (a) discover studies comparing LENA output with manual annotation, namely, accuracy of talker labels, as well as involving adult word counts (AWCs), conversational turn counts (CTCs), and child vocalization counts (CVCs); (b) describe them qualitatively; (c) quantitatively integrate them to assess central tendencies; and (d) quantitatively integrate them to assess potential moderators. Method Searches on Google Scholar, PubMed, Scopus, and PsycInfo were combined with expert knowledge, and interarticle citations resulting in 238 records screened and 73 records whose full text was inspected. To be included, studies must target children under the age of 18 years and report on accuracy of LENA labels (e.g., precision and/or recall) and/or AWC, CTC, or CVC (correlations and/or error metrics). Results A total of 33 studies, in 28 articles, were discovered. A qualitative review revealed most validation studies had not been peer reviewed as such and failed to report key methodology and results. Quantitative integration of the results was possible for a broad definition of recall and precision ( M = 59% and 68%, respectively; N = 12–13), for AWC (mean r = .79, N = 13), CVC (mean r = .77, N = 5), and CTC (mean r = .36, N = 6). Publication bias and moderators could not be assessed meta-analytically. Conclusion Further research and improved reporting are needed in studies evaluating LENA segmentation and quantification accuracy, with work investigating CTC being particularly urgent.

Vitiligo has significant psychosocial impacts on patients and is challenging to manage with limited treatment options. Recent studies have suggested promising results for JAK1/3 inhibitors including tofacitinib and ruxolitinib.To determine the expected response of vitiligo to JAK inhibitor therapy and factors which influence response rates.A systematic review and meta-analysis was performed according to PRISMA guidelines. Good response was defined as repigmentation >50% or a 'good' or 'excellent' outcome as described by authors. Partial response was defined as some repigmentation <50%.From the 9 eligible studies, individual patient data from 45 cases were pooled. Good response was achieved in 57.8%, partial response in 22.2%, and none or minimal response in 20% of cases. When subgrouped according to site, facial vitiligo had the highest good response rate (70%), compared to extremities (27.3%) and torso/non-sun exposed areas (13.6%). Concurrent phototherapy was significant associated with higher rates of good overall response (p < .001) and good facial response (p < .001).There is promising low-quality evidence regarding the effectiveness of JAK inhibitors in vitiligo. Concurrent UVB phototherapy appears to improve efficacy of JAK inhibitors for vitiligo.",0

A key preventive home-based oral health behaviour is the adoption and maintenance of parental supervised toothbrushing until 8 years of age.To examine interventions promoting parental supervised toothbrushing practices to reduce dental caries in young children (<8 years old).Interventions promoting parental involvement in home-based toothbrushing in children under 8 years old and their impact on caries were subjected to review. Electronic databases (MEDLINE, EMBASE, PubMed, Web of Science, PsycINFO, Scopus, and the Cochrane Library), references, and unpublished literature databases were searched for relevant literature.Of the 10 176 articles retrieved, forty-two articles were included. The Theoretical Domains Framework was used to code intervention content, with the main domains addressed being knowledge (41/42), skills (35/42), and environmental context and resources (22/42). Sufficient descriptions of the intervention development, delivery, and evaluation were lacking, with only 18 studies being underpinned by theory. Twenty-nine studies explored the impact on caries yielding mixed results.There are few interventions targeting home-based oral health behaviours underpinned by theory and methodological rigour in their development and evaluation. This demonstrates a clear need for future interventions to be guided by complex intervention methodology.",0

The PubMed and Embase databases were searched to identify potential studies for inclusion. Three common atopic outcomes were included: asthma, eczema, and rhinitis.We found 693 titles, abstracts, and citations, and 6 studies were included in this analysis. A meta-analysis revealed that maternal OCP exposure was associated with higher odds of asthma (odds ratio [OR] 1.1; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.02-1.19; P = .014), rhinitis (OR 1.34; 95% CI 1.07-1.68; P = .011) during childhood, whereas there was no association with eczema (OR 1.17; 95% CI 0.81-1.68; P = .383). This analysis was limited by the small number of studies included and the limited adjustments for the possible confounders in the studies.Current evidence suggests that maternal OCP exposure increases the risk for respiratory allergic diseases (asthma and rhinitis) in the offspring, but not for eczema. Given the few studies included, future larger, prospective studies that control for important confounders are needed to verify our findings.",0

Western guidelines should be used with caution in clinical practice until there is supporting evidence.Systematically synthesize the evidence on the efficacy of achieving the strict 2018 European Society of Cardiology (ESC) guideline BP targets versus standard BP targets in Asian patients.We searched PubMed, Web of Science, Scopus, the Cochrane Central Register of controlled trials, and additional databases to retrieve relevant Asian studies.Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and observational studies that reported clinical endpoints, had a minimal follow-up period of one year and included Asian patients older than 18 years with essential hypertension.Two investigators independently conducted the study selection with any discrepancies resolved between team members.We selected 15 studies for analysis (4 RCTs, 7 observational studies, and 4 post-hoc analyses). The evidence for the strict BP targets in elderly patients was insufficient. In middle-aged patients, the meta-analysis of observational studies revealed a significant reduction in major adverse cardiac events (MACCE) (hazard ratio (HR)=0.78; 95% confidence interval (CI: 0.74-0.81). For studies that reported results for patients of any age, the tight systolic BP-lowering therapy was associated with a decrease in MACCE (HR=0.80; 95% CI: 0.69-0.92), stroke (HR=0.82; 95% CI: 0.71-0.94), but not in cardiac events (HR=0.91; 95% CI: 0.72-1.14, P=.41), all-cause (HR=0.80; 95% CI: 0.57-1.13) and cardiovascular mortality (HR=0.73; 95% CI: 0.40-1.33, P=.30). Similar findings were obtained for the strict diastolic BP targets.Our findings provide evidence for Asian patients that support the efficacy of the strict antihypertensive treatment with BP targets proposed by the 2018 ESC hypertension guidelines for the prevention of cardiovascular events. However, these data were obtained from only observational studies and the results were not confirmed by RCTs, probably due to insufficient power. Therefore, further high-quality RCTs are crucial.Use of aggregated data, the subgroup and meta-regression analyses are inconclusive, limited to English language, unable to estimate summary measures for some outcomes, publication bias difficult to assess, and unclear that results could be extrapolated.The protocol registered in PROSPERO (CRD42018115570).None.",0
https://doi.org/10.1111/mcn.12916,Dietary guideline adherence during preconception and pregnancy: A systematic review,"The aim of this study is to determine the level of adherence to dietary guidelines among men and women during preconception, and pregnant women, and factors associated with adherence. Searches were conducted in CINAHL, AMED, EMBASE, and Maternity and Infant Care from inception to March 2018. Observational studies assessing the primary outcome (adherence to dietary guidelines and/or nutritional recommendations) and/or secondary outcome (factors associated with adherence) were eligible. Study quality was assessed using the National Institutes of Health Quality Assessment Tool for Observational Cohort and Cross-sectional studies. Men or women (aged ≥18 years) who identified as trying/intending to conceive or were pregnant. Eighteen studies were included. The quality of studies was fair (44%) to good (56%). Most studies indicated preconceptual and pregnant women do not meet recommendations for vegetable, cereal grain, or folate intake. Pregnant women did not meet iron or calcium intake requirements in 91% and 55% of included studies, respectively, and also exceeded fat intake recommendations in 55% of included studies. Higher level education was associated with improved guideline adherence in pregnant women, whereas older age and non-smoking status were associated with greater guideline adherence in preconceptual and pregnant women. The findings of this review suggest that preconceptual and pregnant women may not be meeting the minimum requirements stipulated in dietary guidelines and/or nutritional recommendations. This could have potential adverse consequences for pregnancy and birth outcomes and the health of the offspring. Major knowledge gaps identified in this review, which warrant further investigation, are the dietary intakes of men during preconception, and the predictors of guideline adherence.",0

Eight of these studies were on human RCTs, 6 were on rat tendons, 1 considered both human and rat tendons, and 1 was on dog tendon. Five studies analyzed the effects of corticosteroids on the biomechanical properties of RCT or rotator cuff repair, whereas the remaining observed the cellular and molecular effects of CSIs on RCT. Corticosteroids suppress an inflammatory response, induce apoptosis, and have negative effects on collagen and tendon cell viability in RCTs. The mechanical properties, including load to failure of RCTs and rotator cuff repair anchor pull-out strength, also are decreased by CSIs. These in vitro effects appear to be transient as well as frequency and dose dependent.On a molecular level, CSIs decrease cellular proliferation, alter collagen and extracellular matrix composition, impede inflammatory pathways, decrease cellular viability, increase adipocyte differentiation, and increase apoptosis. These changes can be seen as early as 24 hours after corticosteroid exposure, last as long as 2 to 3 weeks, and are exacerbated by increased doses and decreased latency between doses. Biomechanical studies demonstrate that these changes result in decreased maximal load to failure, tendon stiffness, and suture anchor pull-out strength in rat shoulders up to 2 weeks but not at 3 and 4 weeks, post-CSI.Shoulder subacromial steroid injection is common, and practitioners should be aware of results both positive and deleterious.",0

Occupational therapy is often part of the multi-disciplinary approach within the Developmental, Individual-differences, Relationship-based (DIR) Floortime TM Model. The model addresses the emotional development of children, which is considered to be critical for the other child developmental areas. Purpose. This review serves to inform practitioner decision-making about the use of this model, as no systematic reviews exist on child development outcomes. Methods. The systematic search included Medline, Embase, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL), Scopus, and Cochrane. For critical appraisal, the McMaster Critical Review was utilized. Findings. Nine studies were identified with varying quality levels. Outcomes were mostly reported for increased socio-emotional development. Implications. The evidence base for this model is emerging from a published research perspective. It is recommended that the use of this model be supported by sound clinical reasoning processes, intervention fidelity, use of valid outcome measures, and regular monitoring. Higher quality research is urgently needed to progress the research base for this intervention.",0

Part 1: psychological consequences,"To integrate scholastic literature regarding the prevalence and characteristics of the psychological consequences faced by survivors of the 2011 Fukushima earthquake/tsunami/nuclear disaster, we conducted a systematic review of survivor studies concerning the Fukushima disaster. In August 2019, four literature databases (PubMed, PsycINFO, Psychology and Behavioral Sciences Collection, and ICHUSHI) were used in the literature search. Peer-reviewed manuscripts reporting psychological consequences, either in English or Japanese, were selected. A total of 79 studies were selected for the review. Twenty-four studies (30.4%) were conducted as part of the Fukushima Health Management Survey-large-scale cohort study recruiting the residents of the entire Fukushima prefecture. Study outcomes were primarily nonspecific psychological distress, depressive symptoms, post-traumatic stress symptoms, and anxiety symptoms. The rates of high-risk individuals determined by the studies varied significantly owing to methodological differences. Nevertheless, these rates were mostly high (nonspecific psychological distress, 8.3%-65.1%; depressive symptoms, 12%-52.0%; and post-traumatic stress symptoms, 10.5%-62.6%). Many studies focused on vulnerable populations such as children, mothers of young children, evacuees, and nuclear power plant workers. However, few studies reported on the intervention methods used or their effect on the survivors. As a conclusion, high rates of individuals with psychological conditions, as well as a wide range of mental conditions, were reported among the Fukushima nuclear disaster survivors in the first 8 years after the disaster. These findings demonstrate the substantial impact of this compound disaster, especially in the context of a nuclear catastrophe.",0

A systematic review,"Abstract Background Missing data in covariates can result in biased estimates and loss of power to detect associations. It can also lead to other challenges in time-to-event analyses including the handling of time-varying effects of covariates, selection of covariates and their flexible modelling. This review aims to describe how researchers approach time-to-event analyses with missing data. Methods Medline and Embase were searched for observational time-to-event studies in oncology published from January 2012 to January 2018. The review focused on proportional hazards models or extended Cox models. We investigated the extent and reporting of missing data and how it was addressed in the analysis. Covariate modelling and selection, and assessment of the proportional hazards assumption were also investigated, alongside the treatment of missing data in these procedures. Results 148 studies were included. The mean proportion of individuals with missingness in any covariate was 32%. 53% of studies used complete-case analysis, and 22% used multiple imputation. In total, 14% of studies stated an assumption concerning missing data and only 34% stated missingness as a limitation. The proportional hazards assumption was checked in 28% of studies, of which, 17% did not state the assessment method. 58% of 144 multivariable models stated their covariate selection procedure with use of a pre-selected set of covariates being the most popular followed by stepwise methods and univariable analyses. Of 69 studies that included continuous covariates, 81% did not assess the appropriateness of the functional form. Conclusion While guidelines for handling missing data in epidemiological studies are in place, this review indicates that few report implementing recommendations in practice. Although missing data are present in many studies, we found that few state clearly how they handled it or the assumptions they have made. Easy-to-implement but potentially biased approaches such as complete-case analysis are most commonly used despite these relying on strong assumptions and where often more appropriate methods should be employed. Authors should be encouraged to follow existing guidelines to address missing data, and increased levels of expectation from journals and editors could be used to improve practice.",0
https://doi.org/10.1111/inm.12654,The effectiveness of chemical restraint in managing acute agitation and aggression: A systematic review of randomized controlled trials,"One approach to manage people with behaviours of concern including agitated or aggressive behaviours in health care settings is through the use of fast-acting medication, called chemical restraint. Such management often needs to be delivered in crisis situations to patients who are at risk of harm to themselves or others. This paper summarizes the available evidence on the effectiveness and safety of chemical restraint from 21 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) involving 3788 patients. The RCTs were of moderate to high quality and were conducted in pre-hospital, hospital emergency department, or ward settings. Drugs used in chemical restraint included olanzapine, haloperidol, droperidol, risperidol, flunitrazepam, midazolam, promethazine, ziprasidone, sodium valproate, or lorazepam. There was limited comparability between studies in drug choice, combination, dose, method of administration (oral, intramuscular, or intravenous drip), or timing of repeat administrations. There were 31 outcome measures, which were inconsistently reported. They included subjective measures of behaviours, direct measures of treatment effect (time to calm; time to sleep), indirect measures of agitation (staff or patient injuries, duration of agitative or aggressive episodes, subsequent violent episodes), and adverse events. The most common were time to calm and adverse events. There was little clarity about the superiority of any chemical method of managing behaviours of concern exhibited by patients in Emergency Departments or acute mental health settings. Not only is more targeted research essential, but best practice recommendations for such situations requires integrating expert input into the current evidence base.",0

Goal: To determine the global prevalence and causes of NSIs among HCWs. Methods: In this systematic review and meta-analysis, three databases (PubMed, Web of science, and Scopus) were searched for reports from January 1, 2000 to December 31, 2018. The random effects model was used to determine the prevalence of NSIs among HCWs. Hoy et al.’s instrument was employed to evaluate the quality of the included studies. Findings: A total of 87 studies performed on 50,916 HCWs in 31 countries worldwide were included in the study. The one-year global pooled prevalence of NSIs among HCWs was 44.5% (95% CI: 35.7, 53.2). Highest prevalence of NSIs occurred in the South East Asia region at 58.2% (95%, CI: 36.7, 79.8). By job category, prevalence of NSIs was highest among dentists at 59.1% (95% CI: 38.8, 79.4), Hypodermic needles were the most common cause of NSIs at 55.1% (95% CI: 41.4, 68.9). Conclusion: The current high prevalence of NSIs among HCWs suggests need to improve occupational health services and needle-stick education programs globally.",0

Methods We performed a systematic review of phase III parallel-group RCTs in adult men with nmCRPC. Primary outcome was metastasis-free survival (MFS). Secondary outcomes included overall survival (OS), PSA progression-free survival (PFS), and rates of grade 3-4 adverse events (AEs). We assessed class-level effects using random effects models; effect modification due to subgroup effects using random-effects models to pool study-level differences; and comparative outcomes between agents using fixed-effect network models in a Bayesian framework. Results Three RCTs were identified. Pooled MFS, PSA-PFS, and OS were significantly greater with NSAA versus placebo (HR:0.32,95%CI:0.25-0.41, HR:0.08,95%CI:0.05-0.13, HR:0.74,95%CI:0.61-0.90, respectively). Subgroup analysis demonstrated a greater benefit with NSAAs in men with ECOG 0 (HR:0.30,95%CI:0.24-0.38) versus 1 (HR:0.45, 95%CI:0.36-0.56;p=0.005), but no difference due to PSA doubling time (PSADT; p=0.43) or use of osteoclast targeting therapy (p=0.77). Bayesian analysis showed apalutamide and enzalutamide had a 56% and 44% likelihood of maximizing MFS, respectively, with subgroup analysis demonstrating these agents were preferred regardless of PSADT and performance status. There was a 44%, 41%, and 15% likelihood that apalutamide, darolutamide and enzalutamide offered the greatest OS benefit, respectively. Grade 3-4 AEs were more common with NSAAs (OR:1.47,95%CI:1.27-1.71) and there was a 61% chance that darolutamide was preferred. Conclusions NSAAs improve survival in high-risk nmCRPC. Apalutamide and enzalutamide may result in improved oncological outcomes. Darolutamide may result in fewer AEs. Phase IV data are needed to validate these findings.",0
https://doi.org/10.2196/17334,Factors Influencing the Adoption of Health Information Standards in Health Care Organizations: A Systematic Review Based on Best Fit Framework Synthesis,"Background Since the early 1970s, health care provision has experienced rapid growth in the investment and adoption of health information technologies (HITs). However, the development and deployment of HITs has often been conducted in silos, at different organizational levels, within different regions, and in various health care settings; this has resulted in their infrastructures often being difficult to manage or integrate. Health information standards (ie, the set norms and requirements that underpin the deployment of HITs in health care settings) are expected to address these issues, yet their adoption remains to be frustratingly low among health care information technology vendors. Objective This study aimed to synthesize a comprehensive framework of factors that affect the adoption and deployment of health information standards by health care organizations. Methods First, electronic databases, including Web of Science, Scopus, and PubMed, were searched for relevant articles, with the results being exported to the EndNote reference management software. Second, study selection was conducted according to pre-established inclusion and exclusion criteria. Finally, a synthesized best fit framework was created, which integrated a thematic analysis of the included articles. Results In total, 35 records were incorporated into the synthesized framework, with 4 dimensions being identified: technology, organization, environment, and interorganizational relationships. The technology dimension included relative advantage, complexity, compatibility, trialability, observability, switching cost, standards uncertainty, and shared business process attributes. The organization dimension included organizational scale, organizational culture, staff resistance to change, staff training, top management support, and organizational readiness. The environment dimension included external pressure, external support, network externality, installed base, and information communication. Finally, the interorganizational relationships dimension included partner trust, partner dependence, relationship commitment, and partner power. Conclusions The synthesized framework presented in this paper extends the current understanding of the factors that influence the adoption of health information standards in health care organizations. It provides policy and decision makers with a greater awareness of factors that hinder or facilitate their adoption, enabling better judgement and development of adoption intervention strategies. Furthermore, suggestions for future research are provided.",0

This meta-analysis of clinical randomized phase II trials was conducted to systematically evaluate the efficacy and safety of capecitabine-based versus S-1-based chemotherapy for metastatic or recurrent GC. METHODS We searched PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, and Cochrane Library databases to identify studies eligible for the present analysis. Data were collected from inception to June 20th, 2019. Outcomes included objective response rate (ORR); 6-, 12-, and 18-month progression-free survival (PFS); 1-, 2-, and 3-year overall survival (OS); and adverse events. A meta-analysis was conducted using a random-effects model, and a sensitivity analysis was conducted to examine whether the results of the meta-analysis were robust. Risk ratio (RR) or hazard ratio (HR) with 95% confidence interval (CI) was reported as the main evaluation parameters. RESULTS Six eligible studies with 561 subjects were included in the present meta-analysis. There was no significant difference between S-1-based and capecitabine-based chemotherapy in ORR (RR =1.17, 95% CI: 0.95-1.44, P=0.13, I2 =0%); 6-month (HR =0.94, 95% CI: 0.77-1.14, I2 =0%), 12-month (HR =0.89, 95% CI: 0.61-1.31, I2 =0%), and 18-month PFS (HR =1.02, 95% CI: 0.55-1.91, I2 =0%); 1-year (HR =0.99, 95% CI: 0.83-1.18, I2 =0%), 2-year (HR =0.90, 95% CI: 0.58-1.42, I2 =0%), and 3-year OS (HR =1.08, 95% CI: 0.50-2.34, I2 =0%). However, the capecitabine-based chemotherapy had a higher incidence in all grades of hand-foot syndrome (HFS) (RR =3.41, 95% CI: 1.98-5.90, P<0.01, I 2 =39%) and grades 3-4 neutropenia (RR =1.62, 95% CI: 1.05-2.51, P=0.03, I2 =0%). CONCLUSIONS In terms of efficacy, capecitabine-based chemotherapy and S-1-based chemotherapy had similar short-term outcomes. Regarding safety, we recommend S-1-based chemotherapy for patients with metastatic or recurrent GC prior to capecitabine-based treatment.",0
https://doi.org/10.1016/j.maturitas.2020.03.006,Early menopause is associated with increased risk of arterial hypertension: A systematic review and meta-analysis,"Menopausal transition has been associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD), mainly attributed to atherogenic dyslipidaemia, central obesity and insulin resistance. Whether arterial hypertension (AH) also contributes to menopause-associated CVD is currently unknown. The aim of this study was to systematically investigate and meta-analyze the best available evidence regarding the association between early menopause (EM) and AH risk.A comprehensive search was conducted in PubMed, CENTRAL and Scopus databases, up to January 20th, 2020. Data were expressed as odds ratio (OR) with 95 % confidence intervals (CI). The I2 index was employed for heterogeneity.Ten studies were included in the quantitative analysis (273,994 postmenopausal women, 76853 cases with AH). Women with EM (age at menopause <45 years) were at higher AH risk compared with those of normal age at menopause (>45 years) (OR 1.10, 95 % CI 1.01-1.19, p = 0.03; I2 79 %). The direction or the magnitude of this association remained significant when the analysis was restricted to studies including groups matched for potential confounders, such as age, BMI, smoking or the use of menopausal hormone therapy or oral contraceptives.Women with EM have an increased risk for AH compared with those of normal age at menopause.",0

However, no systematic review and meta-analysis have addressed the issue of the safety and efficacy of hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) in coronavirus disease 2019. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis with the objectives of evaluation of safety and efficacy of HCQ alone or in combination in terms of “time to clinical cure,” “virological cure,” “death or clinical worsening of disease,” “radiological progression,” and safety. RevMan was used for meta-analysis. We searched 16 literature databases out of which seven studies (n = 1358) were included in the systematic review. In terms of clinical cure, two studies reported possible benefit in “time to body temperature normalization” and one study reported less “cough days” in the HCQ arm. Treatment with HCQ resulted in less number of cases showing the radiological progression of lung disease (odds ratio [OR], 0.31, 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.11-0.9). No difference was observed in virological cure (OR, 2.37, 95% CI, 0.13-44.53), death or clinical worsening of disease (OR, 1.37, 95% CI, 1.37-21.97), and safety (OR, 2.19, 95% CI, 0.59-8.18), when compared with the control/conventional treatment. Five studies reported either the safety or efficacy of HCQ + azithromycin. Although seems safe and effective, more data are required for a definitive conclusion. HCQ seems to be promising in terms of less number of cases with radiological progression with a comparable safety profile to control/conventional treatment. We need more data to come to a definite conclusion.",0
https://doi.org/10.1097/coc.0000000000000663,Patient Selection for Adjuvant Chemotherapy in High-Risk Stage II Colon Cancer,"OBJECTIVES Patients with high-risk stage II colon cancer (CC) are recommended to undergo adjuvant chemotherapy (ACT). However, whether such patients can benefit from ACT remains unclear. This meta-analysis aimed to investigate the clinicopathologic parameters that are important for selecting patients for ACT in high-risk stage II CC. METHODS We systematically retrieved articles from PubMed, the Cochrane Library, and Embase that were published up to September 13, 2018. We analyzed overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS) based on hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). RESULTS A total of 23 cohort studies and 1 randomized controlled trial were included in our study. Overall analyses showed that ACT improved OS (HR=0.64, 95% CI=0.51-0.80, P<0.001) and DFS (HR=0.46, 95% CI=0.28-0.76, P=0.002) in patients with high-risk stage II CC. Subgroup analyses showed that ACT improved OS in patients with localized intestinal perforation and obstruction and pT4 lesions and improved OS and DFS in patients with <12 sampled lymph nodes. However, ACT had no significant effect on OS in patients with lymphovascular invasion, perineural invasion, or poorly differentiated histology. CONCLUSIONS Our study suggests that not all high-risk factors (lymphovascular invasion, perineural invasion, poorly differentiated histology) show a benefit from ACT. Randomized controlled trials selectively targeting high-risk patients will need to be conducted in the future.",0
https://doi.org/10.1093/biosci/biaa021,The Influence of Forests on Freshwater Fish in the Tropics: A Systematic Review,"Abstract Tropical forests influence freshwater fish through multiple pathways, only some of which are well documented. We systematically reviewed the literature to assess the current state of knowledge on forests and freshwater fish in the tropics. The existing evidence is mostly concentrated in the neotropics. The majority of studies provided evidence that fish diversity was higher where there was more forest cover; this was related to the greater heterogeneity of resources in forested environments that could support a wider range of species. Studies quantifying fish abundance (or biomass) showed mixed relationships with forest cover, depending on species-specific habitat preferences. We identify the key challenges limiting our current understanding of the forest–fish nexus and provide recommendations for future research to address these knowledge gaps. A clear understanding of the functional pathways in forest–freshwater ecosystems can improve evidence-based policy development concerned with deforestation, biodiversity conservation, and food insecurity in the tropics.",0

While most patients reporting penicillin allergy are not prone to anaphylaxis, it is not currently known what percentage of these patients will tolerate dose challenges of penicillin-based antibiotics. This review aims to determine the rate of tolerance in patients reporting penicillin allergy when challenged with penicillin-based antibiotics.We searched MedLine, Embase, and Cochrane Library for publications with English language translations between the years 2000 and 2017. We included randomized controlled trials, quasi-experimental, and observational studies of participants reporting penicillin allergy who received at least one systemic dose of a penicillin in the form of a drug challenge. At least 2 independent reviewers extracted data from included studies and assessed the quality of each included study. To generate primary outcome data, we calculated a summary estimate rate of penicillin tolerance from a pooled proportion of participants receiving penicillin with no adverse effects.Initial literature search yielded 2945 studies, of which 23 studies were ultimately included in our review; 5056 study participants with reported history of penicillin allergy were challenged with a penicillin. After weighting for study sample size, a pooled average of 94.4% (95% confidence interval, 93.7%-95%) of participants tolerated the dose challenge without any adverse reaction.Misrepresented penicillin allergy drives unnecessary use of alternative antibiotics, which may be less effective, more toxic, and more expensive than using penicillin. In addressing the problem of penicillin allergy over-diagnosis, evaluation should go beyond risk for type 1 hypersensitivity. Our data suggest that 94.4% of 5056 participants with reported penicillin allergy determined to be clinically appropriate for allergy evaluation tolerated repeat administration of penicillin-based antibiotics without any adverse reactions. This review generates meaningful information useful to clinical predictive analytics, in evaluating and managing patients with a reported history of penicillin allergy.",0

A systematic review,"INTRODUCTION Spaceflight-Associated Neuro-ocular Syndrome (SANS) was linked to increased intracranial pressure (ICP) attributable to the combined effects of microgravity and environmental conditions encountered during spaceflight. Microgravity countermeasures as lower body negative pressure (LBNP) are potential interventions for SANS. Our aim is to provide a comprehensive qualitative analysis of literature contrasting simulation and spaceflight studies, focusing on the pathophysiology of SANS, and highlighting gaps in current knowledge. EVIDENCE ACQUISITION We systematically searched PubMed electronic database for English primary research published until February 2019 discussing intracranial changes in spaceflight or simulated microgravity, excluding animal and experimental studies. Two authors screened all the abstracts with a third author resolving disagreements. The full-text manuscripts were analyzed in pilot-tested tables. EVIDENCE SYNTHESIS Nineteen studies were reviewed; 13 simulation, and two out of six spaceflight studies were prospective. ICP changes were investigated in 11 simulation studies, where eight demonstrated a significant increase in ICP after variable periods of head-down tilt. three showed a significant increase in intraocular pressure (IOP) in conjunction with ICP elevation. With increasing ambient CO 2 : one showed an increase in IOP without further increase in ICP, while another showed a slight further decrease in ICP. LBNP demonstrated no significant effect on ICP in one and a decrease thereof in another study. After spaceflight, increased ICP on lumbar puncture was demonstrated in five studies. CONCLUSIONS Exposure to microgravity increases ICP possibly precipitating ocular changes. Whether other factors come into play is the subject of investigation. Further randomized studies and methods of direct ICP measurement during spaceflight are needed.",0

Methods An electronic search was undertaken in September 2019. The eligibility criteria included publications that had enough clinical and histological information to confirm the diagnosis. Results Forty-two publications with 122 radiation-induced sarcoma of the oral cavities (RISOCs) were included. The mean latency period was 114 months and mean radiation total dose was 62.5 Gy. The tumors were more prevalent in males between 50 and 60 years old and the mandible was the most affected site. Osteosarcoma was the most prevalent histological type and patients were mostly treated with radical surgery. Conclusions RISOC showed a poor survival rate of 15.1% in 5-year follow-up. Gender and histological type were independently associated with survival.",1

Migration of Hg is determined by its complexation with organic and inorganic ligands that are widely present in the water. The presence of dissolved organic matter (DOM) is closely related to photochemical reactions of Hg. DOM can strongly bind to mercury (e.g., Hg2+ and MeHg), thus affecting its speciation, mobility and toxicity, eventually dominating its bioavailability. This review summarizes extensive studies on photochemical behaviors of Hg including: (1) photo-oxidation; (2) photo-reduction; (3) photochemical methylation; and (4) MeHg photo-degradation. Photo-oxidation of Hg0 is mostly caused by oxidative free radicals (e.g., •OH, CO3•-, O3, and 1O2), while photo-reduction of Hg2+ is more complicated and it involves two pathways: (1) primary processes (direct photolysis of Hg2+ or ligand-metal charge transfer of Hg2+-DOM complex); and (2) secondary processes (reduction of Hg2+-DOM complex induced by free radicals derived from DOM photolysis). Photochemical methylation of inorganic Hg occurs as follows: (1) Hg2+ complexes with methyl donors (e.g., acetic acid, tert-butyl, alcohols, etc.) to form intermediates, followed by (2) an intramolecular methyl transfer. MeHg photo-degradation is the leading pathway for MeHg demethylation and it primarily proceeds via four different pathways. The information on DOM was also mentioned, but DOM is not the only factor that affects the photochemical behaviors of Hg. Other influencing factors such as: (1) pH value; (2) dissolved oxygen; (3) cations (Fe3+, K+) and anions (NO3-, HCO3-, CO32-, Cl-); and (4) suspended substance cannot be ignored.",0

https://doi.org/10.1111/jan.14331,Bullying in nursing evaluated by the Negative Acts Questionnaire‐Revised: A systematic review and meta‐analysis,"Aims To report a synthesis of the empirical studies that used the Negative Acts Questionnaire-Revised (NAQ-R) to assess bullying among nurses based on evaluation of the psychometric properties and use and usability of the instrument and identification of the variables associated with bullying. Design Systematic review and meta-analysis. Data sources Four databases were used in the literature search: PubMed, CINAHL, PsycINFO and Scopus. The search was limited to original publications describing results of empirical studies written in English or Polish and published in peer-reviewed journals between 2002 and 2018. Review methods Two reviewers independently assessed eligibility, extracted data and conducted quality assessment. Based on the extracted data, three separate meta-analyses were conducted. Results Thirty-one articles were included in the review, 13 of which were selected for meta-analysis. In studies where participants reported bullying (N = 19), its prevalence ranged from 17-94%. Variables most often associated with bullying were age, educational level and years of professional experience. Usability of this instrument in different countries was supported by a high reliability in each study. In two meta-analyses, which included 12 studies with mean NAQ-R and item scores, the heterogeneity of data was calculated as high and moderate respectively. Conclusion The good quality of the NAQ-R in determining variables related to bullying is endorsed. Variables related to bullying identified in this review could be used to map out a model of a potential bullying victim for preventative measures. Impact The NAQ-R is a useful and reliable tool for measuring bullying among nurses; however, there remains a strong need to assure that a verified, standardized and updated bullying taxonomy is used in future studies to ensure reliable and comparable data. A model of a potential bullying victim may help nursing directors foster a healthier workplace environment, thereby improving patient outcomes in the long-term.",0

This might help showing which comorbidity might pose the patients at risk of more severe symptoms.We searched all relevant databases on April 7th, 2020 using the keywords (""novel coronavirus"" OR COVID-19 OR SARS-CoV-2 OR Coronavirus) AND (comorbidities OR clinical characteristics OR epidemiologic*). We reviewed 33 papers' full text out of 1053 papers. There were 32 papers from China and 1 from Taiwan. There was no language or study level limit. Prevalence of comorbidities including hypertension, diabetes mellitus, cardiovascular disease, chronic lung disease, chronic kidney disease, malignancies, cerebrovascular diseases, chronic liver disease and smoking were extracted to measure the pooled estimates. We used OpenMeta and used random-effect model to do a single arm meta-analysis.The mean age of the diagnosed patients was 51 years. The male to female ratio was 55 to 45. The most prevalent finding in the confirmed COVID-19 patients was hypertension, which was found in 1/5 of the patients (21%). Other most prevalent finding was diabetes mellitus (DM) in 11%, cerebrovascular disease in 2.4%, cardiovascular disease in 5.8%, chronic kidney disease in 3.6%, chronic liver disease in 2.9%, chronic pulmonary disease in 2.0%, malignancy in 2.7%, and smoking in 8.7% of the patients.COVID-19 infection seems to be affecting every race, sex, age, irrespective of health status. The risk of symptomatic and severe disease might be higher due to the higher age which is usually accompanied with comorbidities. However, comorbidities do not seem to be the prerequisite for symptomatic and severe COVID-19 infection, except hypertension.",0

Design: Medline in Process, PsycINFO, ERIC, Embase, CINAHL, CENTRAL and Scopus databases were searched in March 2019. Studies were included if they (i) evaluated an intervention to improve the diet, physical activity and/or weight of children aged 0–6 years; (ii) were delivered in family day care services; (iii) targeted child diet, physical activity and/or weight; and (iv) used a parallel control group design. Screening was undertaken by two reviewers with disagreements resolved by a third reviewer. Setting: Family day care services, also known as family childcare homes. Participants: Children aged 0–6 years attending family day care services. Results: In total, 8977 titles were retrieved, and 199 full-texts reviewed. No studies met the inclusion criteria for the primary outcome; however, two studies reporting on the secondary outcome of family day care environments were included. The 4-year community-wide obesity prevention programme and the 12-month train-the-trainer programme both reported statistically significant improvements in the healthy eating and physical activity environments of family day care, compared to cross-sectional state-average control groups. Conclusions: Findings highlight few existing interventions in family day care services and a need for high-quality controlled trials to identify effective interventions to improve children’s diet, activity and weight in this setting.",0

This paper offers an overview of recent ETA research prototypes that employ smartphones for assisted orientation and navigation in indoor and outdoor spaces by providing additional information about the surrounding objects. Scientific achievements in the field were systematically reviewed using PRISMA methodology. Comparative meta-analysis showed how various smartphone-based ETA prototypes could assist with better orientation, navigation, and wayfinding in indoor and outdoor environments. The analysis found limited interest among researchers in combining haptic interfaces and computer vision capabilities in smartphone-based ETAs for the blind, few attempts to employ novel state-of-the-art computer vision methods based on deep neural networks, and no evaluations of existing off-the-shelf navigation solutions. These results were contrasted with findings from a survey of blind expert users on their problems in navigating in indoor and outdoor environments. This revealed a major mismatch between user needs and academic development in the field.",0

The primary outcome measure was efficacy, defined by 2-year overall survival (OS). Secondary outcomes were incidence of any grade 3/4 toxicity and 1-year OS. Methods A PICOS/PRISMA/MOOSE selection protocol was used to identify eligible studies. Inclusion criteria were: 1) patients diagnosed with locally advanced N0-1 M0 pancreatic cancer; 2) CFRT 1.8 to 2.0 Gy/fraction with chemotherapy per protocol or SBRT ≥5 Gy/fraction in ≤5 fractions; 3) either no control group or another definitive chemotherapy or radiation therapy arm; 4) at least 1 of the outcome measures reported; and 5) single or multi-arm phase 2/3 prospective study for CFRT and/or phase 1/2 or retrospective study for SBRT. Neoadjuvant and/or adjuvant chemotherapy was prescribed per protocol specifications. Weighted random effects meta-analyses were conducted using the DerSimonian and Laird method to characterize summary effect sizes for each outcome. Results A total of 470 studies were initially screened; of these, 9 studies assessed SBRT and 11 studies assessed CFRT. For SBRT, the median dose was 30 Gy, and the most common regimen was 30 Gy/5 fractions. For CFRT, doses ranged from 45 to 54 Gy in 1.8- to 2.0-Gy fractions, with the majority of studies delivering 50.4 Gy in 28 fractions with concurrent gemcitabine. The random effects estimate for 2-year OS was 26.9% (95% CI, 20.6%-33.6%) for SBRT versus 13.7% (95% CI, 8.9%-19.3%) for CFRT and was statistically significant in favor of SBRT. The random effects estimate for 1-year OS was 53.7% (95% CI, 39.3%-67.9%) for SBRT versus 49.3% (95% CI, 39.3%-59.4%) for CFRT, and was not statistically significant. The random effects estimate for acute grade 3/4 toxicity was 5.6% (95% CI, 0.0%-20.0%) for SBRT versus 37.7% (95% CI, 24.0%-52.5%) for CFRT and was statistically significant in favor of SBRT. The random effects estimate for late grade 3/4 toxicity was 9.0% for SBRT (95% CI, 3.3%-17.1%) versus 10.1% (95% CI, 1.8%-23.8%) for CFRT, which was not statistically significant. Conclusion These results suggest that SBRT for LAPC may result in a modest improvement in 2-year OS with decreased rates of acute grade 3/4 toxicity and no change in 1-year-OS or late toxicity. Further study into the use of stereotactic body radiation therapy for these patients is needed.",0
https://doi.org/10.1016/j.envres.2020.109637,Exposure to light at night (LAN) and risk of obesity: A systematic review and meta-analysis of observational studies,"There is emerging evidence of the association between light at night (LAN) exposure and weight gain.We aim to conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis of observational studies on the association between LAN exposure and risk of obesity in human subjects.Peer-reviewed observational studies were systematically searched from MEDLINE (EBSCO), Academic Search Complete (EBSCO), CINAHL Plus (EBSCO) and PubMed up to December 24, 2019. Random-effects models were developed to estimate the associations between LAN exposure and weight-related outcomes of overweight and obesity as measured by body mass index (BMI), waist circumference, waist-hip-ratio and waist-to-height-ratio. The I2 statistic was used to assess the degree of heterogeneity across studies. The National Toxicology Program's Office of Health Assessment and Translation (OHAT) risk of bias rating tool and the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) guideline were respectively employed to assess the risk of bias and to appraise the quality of the generated evidence.A total of 12 studies (three with longitudinal and nine of cross-sectional design) published between 2003 and 2019 were included for systematic review, while seven of them fulfilling the inclusion/exclusion criteria were included in the meta-analysis. A higher LAN exposure was significantly associated with 13% higher odds of overweight (BMI≥25 kg/m2) (Summary Odds Ratio; SOR: 1.13, 95% CI: 1.10-1.16) with low heterogeneity (I2 = 27.27%), and 22% higher odds of obesity (BMI≥30 kg/m2) (SOR: 1.22, 95% CI: 1.07-1.38) with substantial heterogeneity (I2 = 85.96%). Stratifying analyses by the levels of measurement of LAN exposures (macro-, meso- and micro-levels) and time of LAN measurement (including before and while sleeping) consistently produced robust estimates, with higher exposure to LAN being positively associated with poorer weight outcomes. Assessment of risk of bias identified substantial detection bias for exposure, with over half of the pooled studies employing subjective LAN measures. The overall evidence of the association between LAN exposure and risk of obesity was rated as 'moderate' as per the GRADE guideline.Exposure to LAN was reported to be a significant risk factor for overweight and obesity. Prospectively designed future studies with objectively measured multi-level LAN exposures and weight outcomes are required.",1

Though 26 studies addressed cannabinoid usage, only 8 investigated its therapeutic potential on outcomes such as pain and spasticity. The most common method of use was smoking. Relief of pain, spasticity and recreation were the most common reasons for use. A statistically significant reduction of pain and spasticity was observed with cannabinoid use in 83% and 100% of experimental studies, respectively. However, on examination of randomized control trials (RCTs) alone, effect sizes ranged from - 0.82 to 0.83 for pain and -0.95 to 0.09 for spasticity. Cannabinoid use was associated with fatigue and cognitive deficits.Current evidence suggests that cannabinoids may reduce pain and spasticity in people with SCI, but its effect magnitude and clinical significance are unclear. Existing information is lacking on optimal dosage, method of use, composition and concentration of compounds. Long-term, double-blind, RCTs, assessing a wider range of outcomes should be conducted to further understand the effects of cannabinoid use in people with SCI.",0
https://doi.org/10.1111/phpp.12578,The expression of opsins in the human skin and its implications for photobiomodulation: A Systematic Review,"Background Skin is the organ most extensively exposed to light of a broad range of wavelengths. Several studies have reported that skin expresses photoreceptive molecules called opsins. However, the identity and functional role of opsins in the human skin remain elusive. We aim to summarize current scientific evidence on the types of opsins expressed in the skin and their biological functions. Methods A primary literature search was conducted using PubMed to identify articles on dermal opsins found in nonhuman animals and humans. Results Twenty-two articles, representing, however, a non-exhaustive selection of the scientific papers published in this specific field, met the inclusion criteria. In nonhuman animals, opsins and opsin-like structures have been detected in the skin of fruit fly, zebrafish, frog, octopus, sea urchin, hogfish, and mouse, and they mediate skin color change, light avoidance, shadow reflex, and circadian photoentrainment. In humans, opsins are present in various skin cell types, including keratinocytes, melanocytes, dermal fibroblasts, and hair follicle cells. They have been shown to mediate wound healing, melanogenesis, hair growth, and skin photoaging. Conclusion Dermal opsins have been identified across many nonhuman animals and humans. Current evidence suggests that opsins have biological significance beyond light reception. In nonhuman animals, opsins are involved in behaviors that are critical for survival. In humans, opsins are involved in various functions of the skin although the underlying molecular mechanisms remain unclear. Future investigation on elucidating the mechanism of dermal opsins will be crucial to expand the therapeutic benefits of photobiomodulation for various skin disorders.",0
https://doi.org/10.1007/s11255-020-02488-w,Association of sleep duration with chronic kidney disease and proteinuria in adults: a systematic review and dose–response meta-analysis,"Previous studies have found that sleep duration may be associated with chronic kidney disease (CKD) and proteinuria in adults. However, the correlation remains controversial. In this study, we aimed to assess the effects of sleep duration on CKD and proteinuria. PubMed, EMBASE, and Cochrane Library were searched from their inception up to April 5, 2019 for observational study. The outcomes were CKD and/or proteinuria and the exposure was sleep duration assessed by self-reported questionnaire or interview. Studies were included if they provided risk estimates of effects of sleep duration on patients with CKD or proteinuria. The overall effects were measured by odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI). Heterogeneity was quantified using Q statistics and the I2 statistics. The potential causes of heterogeneity were investigated using sensitivity analysis. Eleven observational studies with 521,242 individuals were included. The adjusted ORs of CKD in individuals who slept ≤ 6 h/night and ≥ 8 h/night were 1.13 (95% CI, 1.02–1.25; I2 = 29%) and 1.14 (95% CI, 1.07–1.22; I2= 0%), respectively. Meanwhile, the adjusted ORs of proteinuria in those who slept ≤ 6 h/night and ≥ 8 h/night were 1.24 (95% CI, 1.06–1.44; I2 = 61%) and 1.15 (95% CI, 1.04–1.29; I2 = 0%), respectively. Furthermore, a U-shaped relationship was observed between sleep duration and CKD or proteinuria, with the lowest risk at 7 h/night of sleep. Both short and long sleep durations are significantly associated with CKD and proteinuria. Our findings suggest curvilinear dose–response associations of sleep duration with CKD and proteinuria.",0

However, while trauma and bereavement interlink, prior studies have focused on trauma and its related disorders (PTSD) and predictive factors. This paper reviewed up-to-date literature on the prevalence rates of prolonged grief disorder (PGD), its comorbidities, and associated risk factors among adult refugees. Method We systematically reviewed the literature using five databases (PsycINFO, PsycARTICLES, Psychology and Behavioral Sciences Collection, Academic Search Elite, and PubMed). The process of study selection was designed according to PRISMA guidelines. Results The initial search generated 126 articles, of which 12 met the inclusion criteria. The pooled prevalence of PGD was 33.2% (95% CI: 15.2–54.2%). Being an older refugee, traumatic and multiple losses implying the death of first-degree relatives appeared to be consistent risk factors for PGD, combined PTSD/PGD, depression, idioms of distress, and functional impairment. PGD, PTSD, and PTSD/PGD intersect on PTSD-intrusions and painful memories. Limitations All included studies adopted a cross-sectional design, thus limiting the understanding of causal pathways. Conclusions Our findings showed that the high prevalence of PGD and related comorbidities were influenced by the load of traumatic circumstances surrounding the death(s). The findings shed light on the current proposed grief-related diagnostic criteria . Psychopathological and transcultural aspects are discussed, and we provide concrete recommendations for improvements to future research in this field.",0
https://doi.org/10.1016/j.hemonc.2020.05.006,Noninfectious neurologic complications of hematopoietic cell transplantation: A systematic review,"Neurological complications occur at a high frequency after hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT). However, an absence is noted in the published literature as regards the quantification of the exact burden and the outcomes thereof. In this systematic review, we endeavored to detail if the recipients of HCT developed any noninfectious neurological events/complications. According to the PICO criteria, medical literature was searched. Complications that were evaluated included: stroke, peripheral neuropathy, myasthenia gravis, seizures, and posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome. After strictly defining relevant variables and parameters, data from 173 eligible articles were then extracted accordingly, from the full text for each, for quantitative analysis; additionally, two American Society of Hematology conference abstracts were also subject to data extraction. As is evident from the results of the data analysis, an increased frequency of these complications was seen in the HCT recipient population in comparison to the general population. The relative risk ranged from 1.33× to 142× depending on the complication studied. These findings demonstrate that the recipients of HCT had a significantly higher risk of neurological complications and that their early recognition can enhance the monitoring of HCT survivors for the early developmental signs of neurological toxicity. This would facilitate timely interventions, thus ensuring a better quality of life.",0

We conducted this systematic review and meta-analysis to determine the significance of clinical and subclinical troponin elevation after vascular surgery. <h3>Methods</h3> We searched MEDLINE (Ovid), Embase (Ovid), and the Cochrane Library, without language restriction, from inception to May 2019 and included studies that reported associations between elevated postoperative troponin and short-term mortality, major adverse cardiac events (MACEs), or long-term mortality in a vascular surgery cohort. We synthesized study-level data on the maximally adjusted estimates using mixed effects modeling to generate summary odds ratios (ORs) for fixed-interval outcomes and summary hazard ratios for long-term mortality. Between-study heterogeneity was assessed with meta-regression. Methodologic quality and publication bias were formally assessed. <h3>Results</h3> We included 24 studies involving 11,657 participants. Postoperative troponin was found to have a strong, positive association with short-term mortality (OR, 4.95; 95% confidence interval [CI], 2.87-8.52; 7 studies; 2661 people) and MACEs (OR, 5.33; 95% CI, 1.59-17.82; 12 studies; 5047 people) independent of meeting the criteria for myocardial infarction. Subclinical postoperative troponin elevation was further demonstrated to be associated with greater long-term mortality (hazard ratio, 1.94; 95% CI, 1.56-2.42; 13 studies; 7630 people; median follow-up, 24 months). Time to troponin sampling, hypertension, and type of surgery partially accounted for between-study heterogeneity. The methodologic quality of included studies was variable, and publication bias was not detected. <h3>Conclusions</h3> Elevated postoperative troponin is strongly prognostic of worse survival and greater likelihood of MACEs after vascular surgery, regardless of whether symptoms of myocardial ischemia are present. These data support the benefit of postoperative troponin monitoring in identifying patients at increased risk of worse outcomes and who may be candidates for personalized preventive interventions.",0

Materials and Methods Four databases, including PubMed, Embase, Web of Science and Scopus, were searched until January, 2019. The search terms “dental implant, oral implant, smoking, smoker, tobacco, nicotine and non-smoker” were used in combination to identify the publications providing data for dental implant failures related to the smoking habit. Publications were excluded if the quantity of cigarettes consumed per day was not reported. Fixed- or random-effects meta-analyses were used to pool the estimates of relative risk (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI). Results Having additional information supplied by the authors, 23 articles were selected for final analysis. The meta-analyses based on implant- and patient-related data showed a significant increase in the RR of implant failure in patients who smoked >20 cigarettes per day compared with non-smokers (implant based: p = .001; RR: 2.45; CI: 1.42–4.22 and patient based: p < .001; RR: 4; CI: 2.72–5.89).

Early childhood is highly influenced by the family-based environment that mostly includes parents. This systematic review synthesized and examined the effects of family-based intervention for early childhood (two to five years) weight management among low-income families. Electronic databases (MEDLINE, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature, EMBASE, Cochrane electronic databases, and Google scholar databases) and published literature were searched for empirical studies and seven articles were included based on inclusion criteria. For each study, quality assessment, data extraction, and synthesis were conducted as guidelines Cochrane and Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses. In four randomized controlled trials, two before and two after intervention studies, and one quasi-experimental study, 890 participants were included in the family-based child weight management intervention. There was significant reduction in early childhood weight in four studies. The evidence for revealing the effect of family-based intervention was insufficient and inconsistent. However, the findings suggest limitations of family-based children weight management intervention in low-income families and could contribute as an indicator for future effective intervention development.",0
https://doi.org/10.1016/j.tmaid.2019.101496,Imported human Schistosoma japonicum: A report on two cases in Filipino migrants present in Italy and a systematic review of literature,"Abstract Background Schistosoma japonicum is endemic in the Philippines, China, and Indonesia, and is the third-most common schistosoma species. The infection can be asymptomatic for years but, if left untreated, can lead to irreversible complications. Method We report the results of a systematic review of the literature on imported S. japonicum infection and describe two previously unpublished cases diagnosed in Filipino migrants in Italy. Results Twenty-five imported cases of S. japonicum schistosomiasis were retrieved. All patients but one were migrants. Most subjects acquired the infection in Philippines (n = 18, 72%). Median age at diagnosis was 46 years. Median period of residence in non-endemic countries before diagnosis was 14.5 years. Cases of prevalent hepatosplenic involvement were 10 (40%), those with prevalent intestinal involvement were 10 (40%), whereas five (20%) had overlapping manifestations. Ten patients suffered from cirrhosis; two underwent liver transplantation. Three patients presented with acute abdomen due to intestinal complications, leading to explorative laparotomy. In all cases, but one, the diagnosis was based on a histological examination of biopsy specimen, revealing S. japonicum ova. Seventeen patients were treated with praziquantel, and in three of them, possible treatment failures occurred. Conclusions S. japonicum infection is uncommonly reported in non-endemic areas, but is probably underestimated because of a low threshold awareness of clinicians and unavailability of specific diagnostic tools. Viable S. japonicum adults may persist for decades, indicating that migrants or travellers previously exposed in areas with high-risk areas can harbour viable worms and deserve treatment.",0
https://doi.org/10.1016/j.envres.2020.109464,The association between environmental endocrine disruptors and cardiovascular diseases: A systematic review and meta-analysis,"Except for known cardiovascular risk factors, long-term exposure to environmental endocrine disruptors (EEDs) - a class of exogenous chemicals, or a mixture of chemicals, that can interfere with any aspect of hormone action - has been shown to increase the risk of cardiovascular diseases (CVDs), which are still controversial.To conduct a comprehensive systematic review and meta-analysis to estimate the association between EEDs, including nonylphenol (NP), bisphenol A (BPA), polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB), organo-chlorine pesticide (OCP) and phthalate (PAE) exposure and CVD risk.The heterogeneity between different studies was qualitatively and quantitatively evaluated using Q test and I2 statistical magnitude, respectively. Subgroup analysis was performed using chemical homologs - a previously unused grouping method - to extract data and perform meta-analysis to assess their exposure to CVD.Twenty-nine literatures were enrolled with a total sample size of 88891. The results indicated that exposure to PCB138 and PCB153 were the risk factors for CVD morbidity (odds ratio (OR) = 1.35, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.10-1.66; OR = 1.35, 95% CI: 1.13-1.62). Exposure to organo-chlorine pesticide (OCP) (OR = 1.12, 95% CI: 1.00-1.24), as well as with phthalate (PAE) (OR = 1.11, 95% CI: 1.06-1.17) and BPA (OR = 1.19, 95% CI: 1.03-1.37) were positively associated with CVD risk, respectively. BPA exposure concentration had no correlation with total cholesterol (TC), or low-density lipoprotein (LDL), but exhibited a correlation with gender, waist circumference (WC), high-density lipoprotein (HDL), age, and body mass index (BMI) (standardized mean difference (SMD)) = 1.51; 95% CI: =(1.01-2.25); SMD = 0.16; 95% CI: (0.08-0.23); SMD = -0.19; 95% CI: (-0.27-0.12); SMD = -0.78; 95% CI: (-1.42-0.14); SMD = 0.08; 95% CI: (0.00-0.16).EED exposure is a risk factor for CVD. Long-term exposure to EEDs can influence cardiovascular health in humans. A possible synergistic effect may exist between the homologs. The mechanism of which needs to be further explored and demonstrated by additional prospective cohort studies, results of in vitro and in vivo analyses, as well as indices affecting CVD.",1

The purpose of this systematic review was to identify existing disparities in retention in care. The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis Protocols (PRISMA-P) 2015 guided this systematic review. Electronic databases, including PubMed/MEDLINE, CINAHL, Sociological Collection, PsychInfo, and Cab Direct/Global Health, were systematically searched and twenty studies were included. This review identified disparities in retention in care that have been documented by race, gender, age, HIV exposure, incarceration history, place of birth, and U.S. geographic location. Research is necessary to further identify existing disparities in retention in care and to better understand determinants of health disparities. Additionally, interventions must be tailored to meet the needs of health disparate populations and should be assessed to determine their effectiveness in reducing health disparities.",0

Methods We searched for articles on occupational formaldehyde exposure and lung cancer in PubMed, EMBASE, Web of Science, and CINAHL databases. In total, 32 articles were selected and 31 studies were included in a meta-analysis. Subgroup analyses and quality assessments were also performed. Results The risk of lung cancer among workers exposed to formaldehyde was not significantly increased, with an overall pooled risk estimate of 1.04 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.97-1.12). The pooled risk estimate of lung cancer was increased when higher exposure studies were considered (1.19; 95% CI, 0.96-1.46). More statistically robust results were obtained when high quality (1.13; 95% CI, 1.08-1.19) and recent (1.13; 95% CI, 1.07-1.19) studies were used in deriving pooled risk estimates. Conclusions No significant increase in the risk of lung cancer was evident in the overall pooled risk estimate; even in higher formaldehyde exposure groups. Our findings do not provide strong evidence in favor of formaldehyde as a risk factor for lung cancer. However, since risk estimates were significantly increased for high-quality and recent studies, the possibility that exposure to formaldehyde can increase the risk of lung cancer might still be considered.",1

Researchers are confronted with a broad diversity of models and techniques in various species. This systematic review aims to summarize and categorize extracranial aneurysm models and their characteristics, discuss advantages and disadvantages, and suggest the best use of each model. We searched the electronical Medline/PubMed database between 1950 and 2020 to identify main models and their refinements and technical modifications for creation of extracranial aneurysms. Each study included was assessed for aneurysm-specific characteristics, technical details of aneurysm creation, and histological findings. Among more than 4000 titles and abstracts screened, 473 studies underwent full-text analysis. From those, 68 different techniques/models in five different species were identified, analyzed in detail, and then grouped into one of the five main groups of experimental models as sidewall, terminal, stump, bifurcation, or complex aneurysm models. This systematic review provides a compact guide for investigators in selecting the most appropriate model from a range of techniques to best suit their experimental goals, practical considerations, and laboratory environment.",0

The optimal investigation of NVH is unclear, given the incidence of cancer and the public health implications of testing all individuals with this finding. We review contemporary literature to determine the association of NVH with the diagnosis of bladder cancer (BC), upper tract urothelial carcinoma (UTUC), and kidney cancer (KC). A systematic review of original articles in English was completed in May 2019. Meta-analyses for the diagnostic accuracy of NVH and urine cytology were performed. We screened 1529 articles and selected 78 manuscripts that fulfilled our inclusion criteria for narrative synthesis. Forty manuscripts were eligible for a meta-analysis (reporting 19 193 persons). The likelihood of a urological cancer in patients with NVH increased with age (<1% in those aged <40 yr), male sex, and cigarette smoking. Less than 1% of patients are found to have a urological cancer after a negative NVH evaluation. Cancer detection rates in individuals evaluated for NVH ranged from 0% to 16% for BC in 37 studies, 0% to 3.5% for UTUC in 30 studies, and 0% to 9.7% for KC in 29 studies. Substantial statistical heterogeneity was present for the meta-analysis of detection rates. We present an up-to-date review of the association of NVH with the diagnosis of BC, UTUC, and KC. Individuals with dipstick positive haematuria aged ≥40 yr, who have had potential precipitating causes excluded, should undergo an evaluation. Re-evaluation of patients with unremarkable initial investigations should be performed in high-risk patients or if new symptoms occur. One in five people have microscopic traces of blood in their urine. This is an important indicator of urological cancer. Investigating all patients is uncomfortable and expensive. We evaluate the risk of cancer and estimate risks to groups of individuals. Up to 20% of the general population have non-visible haematuria (NVH). NVH is an important indicator of urological malignancy, particularly in individuals ≥40 yr of age. Evaluation should include cystoscopy and upper tract imaging in the form of ultrasound or computed tomography urogram.",0

Failure to handle neighbourhood self-selection can lead to biased estimates of the association between the neighbourhood environment and behaviour. This means that effects could be over- or under-estimated, both of which have implications for public health policies related to neighbourhood (re)design. Therefore, it is important that methods to deal with neighbourhood self-selection are identified and reviewed. The aim of this review was to assess how neighbourhood self-selection is conceived and accounted for in the literature. Methods Articles from a systematic search undertaken in 2017 were included if they examined associations between neighbourhood environment exposures and adult physical activity or dietary behaviour. Exposures could include any objective measurement of the built (e.g., supermarkets), natural (e.g., parks) or social (e.g., crime) environment. Articles had to explicitly state that a given method was used to account for neighbourhood self-selection. The systematic review was registered with the PROSPERO International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews (number CRD42018083593) and was conducted in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) statement. Results Of 31 eligible articles, almost all considered physical activity (30/31); few examined diet (2/31). Methods used to address neighbourhood self-selection varied. Most studies (23/31) accounted for items relating to participants’ neighbourhood preferences or reasons for moving to the neighbourhood using multi-variable adjustment in regression models (20/23) or propensity scores (3/23). Of 11 longitudinal studies, three controlled for neighbourhood self-selection as an unmeasured confounder using fixed effects regression. Conclusions Most studies accounted for neighbourhood self-selection by adjusting for measured attributes of neighbourhood preference. However, commonly the impact of adjustment could not be assessed. Future studies using adjustment should provide estimates of associations with and without adjustment for self-selection; consider temporality in the measurement of self-selection variables relative to the timing of the environmental exposure and outcome behaviours; and consider the theoretical plausibility of presumed pathways in cross-sectional research where causal direction is impossible to establish.",0
https://doi.org/10.1111/acer.14332,A Systematic Review of the Effects of Perinatal Alcohol Exposure and Perinatal Marijuana Exposure on Adult Neurogenesis in the Dentate Gyrus,"Marijuana and alcohol are both substances that, when used during pregnancy, may have profound effects on the developing fetus. There is evidence to suggest that both drugs have the capacity to affect working memory, one function of the hippocampal formation; however, there is a paucity of data on how perinatal exposure to alcohol or cannabis impacts the process of adult neurogenesis.This systematic review examines immunohistochemical data from adult rat and mouse models that assess perinatal alcohol or perinatal marijuana exposure. A comprehensive list of search terms was designed and used to search 3 separate databases. All results were imported to Mendeley and screened by 2 authors. Consensus was reached on a set of final papers that met the inclusion criteria, and their results were summarized.Twelve papers were identified as relevant, 10 of which pertained to the effects of perinatal alcohol on the adult hippocampus, and 2 pertained to the effects of perinatal marijuana on the adult hippocampus. Cellular proliferation in the dentate gyrus was not affected in adult rats and mice exposed to alcohol perinatally. In general, perinatal alcohol exposure did not have a significant and reliable effect on the maturation and survival of adult born granule neurons in the dentate gyrus. In contrast, interneuron numbers appear to be reduced in the dentate gyrus of adult rats and mice exposed perinatally to alcohol. Perinatal marijuana exposure was also found to reduce inhibitory interneuron numbers in the dentate gyrus.Perinatal alcohol exposure and perinatal marijuana exposure both act on inhibitory interneurons in the hippocampal formation of adult rats. These findings suggest simultaneous perinatal alcohol and marijuana exposure (SAM) may have a dramatic impact on inhibitory processes in the dentate gyrus.",1

We aimed to describe the characteristics, health outcomes and reasons given for non-attendance at doctor- or nurse-led diabetes appointments, and interventions to improve attendance. Methods PubMed, EMBASE, CINAHL and PsychInfo were searched from database inception to February 2019. Included articles were peer-reviewed, published in English, related to adults or young people with type 1 or type 2 diabetes, and addressed one of the above aspects of non-attendance. Studies were excluded if reporting on other types of diabetes or reviewing attendance at structured education, retinal screening, paediatric, antenatal, podiatry or dietetic clinics. Results Thirty-four studies of varied designs were identified (15 observational, 1 randomized control trial, 9 qualitative, 5 surveys, 4 service improvements). The definition of non-attendance varied. Younger adults, smokers and those with financial pressures were less likely to attend. Non-attendance was associated with higher HbA1c ; other outcomes were varied but typically worse in non-attenders. Reasons for non-attendance in qualitative studies fell into three categories: balancing the costs and benefits of attendance, coping strategies, and the relationships between the person with diabetes and healthcare professionals. Interventions included appointment management strategies, service improvements, patient navigators and WebCam appointments. Conclusions Non-attendance is only partially explained by logistical issues. Qualitative studies suggest complex psychosocial factors are involved. Interventions have progressed from simple appointment reminders in an attempt to address some of the psycho-social determinants, but more work is needed to improve attendance.",0

Comparative global data are scarce and so this review aimed to summarize current evidence on the association between occupational exposure to solarUVRand the development ofKCs, with a specific focus on geographical location and skin colour. OvidMEDLINE, PubMed, Embase and Web of Science were searched for potentially relevant records. Extracted data were summarized by study, country and region. We included one prospective cohort study and 18 case-control studies (n= 15 233) from 12 countries in regions where the majority of the population is white skinned (Americas, Europe and Oceania). Eighteen of the 19 studies reported effect estimates suggesting an increased risk of basal cell carcinoma (BCC) and/or squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) among outdoor workers. Only 11 studies found a significantly increased risk and many had imprecise estimates. There was a significantly increased risk ofBCCandSCCin individual studies in North America, Latin America and the Caribbean, Western Europe and Southern Europe, but not across regions or countries. Overall, 95% of studies reported higher risks among outdoor workers, although the increases in risk were statistically significant in just over half of the studies. Well-designed and sufficiently powered occupational case-control and cohort studies with adequate adjustment for confounding factors and other risk factors are required to provide more accurate risk estimates for occupationalKC.",1
https://doi.org/10.1111/ajd.13211,A Systematic review and Meta‐Analysis of the survival and clinicopathological features of p63 expression in Merkel cell carcinoma,"Merkel cell carcinoma (MCC) is a rare skin tumour of neuroendocrine origin with aggressive behaviour. The aims of this study were to investigate the association of p63 + MCC with clinicopathological features and to estimate survival through a systematic review and meta-analysis. A comprehensive search of PubMed, Embase, Scopus and Virtual Health Library following the PRISMA guidelines was conducted on September 2017. DerSimonian and Lard random-effects models were used to calculate survival-weighted means and their corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CI) among studies. Five studies met our inclusion criteria after screening 77 citations and 36 full-text articles. The included studies enrolled 413 patients with MCC. We observed that p63 + MCC was significantly associated with mortality with OR 2.92 (95% CI [1.66-5.13]). The summary hazard ratio of multivariate analysis was 1.99 (95% CI [1.32-3.01]). The only clinicopathological feature associated with p63 + MCC with statistical significance was the Merkel cell polyomavirus (MCPyV) status. The presence of MCPyV was associated as a protective factor for the expression of p63 (OR 0.25, 95% CI [0.08-0.73]). These results support that p63 + MCC evaluated by immunohistochemistry has a poor outcome. Therefore, we suggest p63 to be performed when staging MCC.",0

We reviewed the association of ART and other HIV-related factors on anal HPV infection, anal intraepithelial neoplasia (AIN), and anal cancer among people living with HIV.For this systematic review and meta-analysis, we searched MEDLINE and EMBASE for studies published between Jan 1, 1996, and Oct 30, 2019, that reported the association of HIV-related exposures (ART or highly active ART [HAART], HIV-RNA plasma viral load [PVL], and nadir or current CD4 cell count) with outcomes of anal high-risk HPV prevalence, incidence, and persistence; prevalence, incidence, progression, or regression of anal histological and cytological abnormalities; and anal cancer incidence. Effect estimates were extracted whenever available; otherwise, they were calculated from raw data. We assessed the risk of bias of included studies using the Newcastle-Ottawa scale, and random-effects meta-analyses were done to examine heterogeneity using the I2 statistic. This study is registered on the PROSPERO database, CRD42018007271.We identified 6777 studies, of which 5377 were excluded before full-text review. 122 studies providing estimates for 130 distinct populations matched the inclusion criteria. The populations comprised 417 006 people living with HIV (women, men who have sex with men, and men who have sex with women). 41 (32%) population estimates were not stratified by sex or sexual orientation. People living with HIV receiving ART had 35% lower high-risk HPV prevalence than ART-naive people (crude odds ratio [OR] 0·65, 95% CI 0·54-0·79; I2 12·1%, p=0·31) in 18 studies, and prolonged ART use was associated with a 10% reduction per year in high-risk HPV prevalence in two studies (adjusted OR 0·90, 0·85-0·95; I2 0%, p=0·88). People living with HIV with undetectable PVL had lower HSIL-AIN2+ prevalence than those with detectable PVL (crude OR 0·84, 0·72-0·98; I2 0%, p=0·80) in 16 studies, particularly if sustained for more than 1 year (crude OR 0·62, 0·47-0·81; I2 0%, p=0·51). ART was not associated with anal cancer incidence when adjusted for years living with HIV in three studies (adjusted hazard ratio [HR] 1·11, 95% CI 0·68-1·80; I2 0%, p=0·57), but ART users with sustained undetectable HIV PVL had 44% lower risk of anal cancer than those without (adjusted HR 0·56, 0·44-0·70; I2 0%, p=0·94) and for each increase in nadir CD4 cell counts of 100 cells per μL, there was a 40% decrease in anal cancer incidence (crude HR 0·60, 0·46-0·78; I2 21·7%, p=0·26).Effective ART use and early initiation at high nadir CD4 counts might reduce anal high-risk HPV infection and anal cancer risk. Although most studies were cross-sectional in design and few adjusted for potential confounders, this analysis provides comprehensive estimates of the effect of ART and HIV-related factors on the natural history of anal HPV-related disease in people living with HIV.EU Marie Skłodowska-Curie Actions programme.",0

These travelers can be exposed to (multi) resistant microorganisms, may become colonized, and bring them back home. This systematic review aims to identify the carriage rates of multidrug-resistant Enterobacterales (MDR-E) among returning travelers, to identify microbiological methods used, and to identify the leading risk factors for acquiring MDR-E during international travel. Methods Articles related to our research question were identified through a literature search in multiple databases (until June 18, 2019) - Embase, Medline Ovid, Cochrane, Scopus, Cinahl, Web of Science, and Google Scholar. Results Out of 3211 potentially relevant articles, we included 22 studies in the systematic review, and 12 studies in 7 random-effects meta-analyses. Highest carriage rates of MDR-E were observed after travel to Southern Asia (median 71%), followed by travel to Northern Africa (median 42%). Carbapenemase-producing Enterobacterales (CPE) were identified in 5 out of 22 studies, from a few patients. However, in only eight out of 22 studies (36.4%) the initial laboratory method targeted detection of the presence of CPE in the original samples. The risk factor with the highest pooled odds ratio (OR) for MDR-E was travel to Southern Asia (pooled OR = 14.16, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 5.50 to 36.45), followed by antibiotic use during travel (pooled OR = 2.78, 95% CI = 1.76 to 4.39). Conclusions Risk of acquiring MDR-E while travelling increases depending on travel destination and if antibiotics are used during travel. This information is useful for the development of guidelines for healthcare facilities with low MDR-E prevalence rates to prevent admission of carriers without appropriate measures. The impact of such guidelines should be assessed.",0

Outcomes of interest were adverse pregnancy outcome, miscarriage, stillbirth, preterm delivery, low birthweight, abortion and malformation.The search was run in MEDLINE/PubMed, SCOPUS and Embase databases from inception up to December 2019.Inclusion criteria were: (1) studies that investigated the association between oral cholera vaccines and adverse pregnancy outcomes; (2) studies that reported outcomes with appropriate estimates; and (3) studies that contained an unvaccinated control group.A random-effects model (DerSimonian and Laird) was run to evaluate the overall treatment effect (relative risk, RR). The PRISMA statement was followed in reporting this meta-analysis.Five studies included in meta-analysis with 5584 women (2920 exposed and 2664 not exposed). No significant increase in adverse pregnancy outcome (RR 1.03, 95% CI 0.79-1.34), miscarriage (RR 1.15, 95% CI 0.84-1.57) or stillbirth (RR 1.11, 95% CI 0.69-1.80) following cholera vaccine administration was found compared with control group. There was also no association with an increased risk of preterm delivery (RR 0.61, 95% CI 0.35-1.06) low birthweight (RR 0.84, 95% CI 0.56- 1.26), accidental abortion (RR 1.02, 95% CI 0.77-1.35) or malformation (RR 0.70, 95% CI 0.22-2.25).This study shows no evidence of an association between oral cholera vaccination and adverse pregnancy outcomes. The findings do not rigorously exclude the possibility that the vaccine protocol may result in some degree of harm.There is no evidence of an association between oral cholera vaccination and adverse pregnancy outcomes.

We performed systematic review and meta-analysis to determine whether air pollutants were risk factors for the development of ADHD in children. We systematically searched databases for all relevant studies up to 2 July 2019. Together, the studies indicated that exposure to PAHs (risk ratio (RR): 0.98, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.82-1.17), NOx (RR: 1.04, 95% CI: 0.94-1.15), and PM (RR: 1.11, 95% CI: 0.93-1.33) did not have any material relationship with an increased risk of ADHD. Heterogeneity of study data was low (I2: 2.7%, P = 0.409) for studies examining PAHs, but was substantial for NOx and PM (I2: 68.4%, P = 0.007 and I2: 60.1%, P = 0.014, respectively).

Materials and methods Thirty-seven studies were identified. Primary outcomes were 1-year local control (LC) and acute/late grade 3–5 toxicities (including vertebral compression fractures (VCF)). Weighted random effects meta-analyses using the DerSimonian and Laird methods and meta-regressions were conducted to characterize and compare effect sizes. Mixed effects regression models were used in dose analyses. Results A total of 3237 patients with 4911 lesions were included; 43.8%, 19.7%, and 36.5% of lesions received SF-SRS, MF-SRS, or RT, respectively. SF-SRS resulted in improved 1-year LC (92.9% (95% CI: 86.4–97.4%); p = 0.007) compared to RT (81.0% (95% CI: 69.2–90.5%)) with no difference between MF-SRS (82.1%; p = 0.86) and RT. On subgroup analysis of de novo metastases, superior 1-year LC following SF-SRS (95.5% (95% CI: 87.4–99.6%)) was maintained compared to RT (83.6% (95% CI: 70.4–93.5%); p = 0.007). A 4.7% increase in LC was noted for each 10 Gy10 increase in biologically effective dose (BED10, assuming an alpha/beta = 10) with SRS (p  Conclusion SF-SRS resulted in superior LC with a roughly 5% LC benefit for every 10 Gy10 increase in BED10 with higher VCF rates compared to MF-SRS.

The relationship between ACEI/ARB use and COVID-19 infection was systematically reviewed. To identify relevant studies that met predetermined inclusion criteria, unrestricted searches of the PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane Library databases were conducted. The search strategy included clinical date published until May 9, 2020. Twelve articles involving more than 19,000 COVID-19 cases were included. To estimate overall risk, random-effects models were adopted. Our results showed that ACEI/ARB exposure was not associated with a higher risk of COVID-19 infection (OR = 0.99; 95 % CI, 0–1.04; P = 0.672). Among those with COVID-19 infection, ACEI/ARB exposure was also not associated with a higher risk of having severe infection (OR = 0.98; 95 % CI, 0.87–1.09; P = 0.69) or mortality (OR = 0.73, 95 %CI, 0.5–1.07; P = 0.111). However, ACEI/ARB exposure was associated with a lower risk of mortality compared to those on non-ACEI/ARB antihypertensive drugs (OR = 0.48, 95 % CI, 0.29−0.81; P = 0.006). In conclusion, current evidence did not confirm the concern that ACEI/ARB exposure is harmful in patientswith COVID-19 infection. This study supports the current guidelines that discourage discontinuation of ACEIs or ARBs in COVID-19 patients and the setting of the COVID-19 pandemic.",0
https://doi.org/10.1002/cam4.3110,A systematic review of evidence for and against routine surveillance imaging after completing treatment for childhood extracranial solid tumors,"Regular off-treatment imaging is often used to assess for recurrence of disease after childhood cancer treatment. It is unclear if this increases survival, or what burden surveillance places on patients, families, or health-care services. This systematic review examines the impact of routine surveillance imaging after treatment of pediatric extracranial solid tumors.Collaborative patient and public involvement informed the design and interpretation of this work. Thirteen electronic databases, conference proceedings, and trial registries were searched alongside reference list checking and forward citation searching from 1990 onwards. Studies were screened and data were extracted by two researchers. Risk of bias was assessed using a modified ROBINS-I tool. Relevant outcomes were overall survival, psychological distress indicators, number of imaging tests, cost-effectiveness, and qualitative data regarding experiences of surveillance programs. PROSPERO (CRD42018103764).Of 17 727 records identified, 55 studies of 10 207 patients were included. All studies used observational methods. Risk of bias for all except one study was moderate, serious, or critical. Data were too few to conduct meta-analysis; however, narrative synthesis was performed. Surveillance strategies varied, and poorly reported, involving many scans and substantial radiation exposure (eg, neuroblastoma, median 133.5 mSv). For most diseases, surveillance imaging was not associated with increased overall survival, with the probable exception of Wilms tumor. No qualitative or psychological distress data were identified.At present, there is insufficient evidence to evaluate the effects of routine surveillance imaging on survival in most pediatric extracranial solid tumors. More high-quality data are required, preferably through randomized controlled trials with well-conducted qualitative elements.",0

However, the true incidence of venous thromboembolism (VTE) after these surgeries is unknown resulting in weak recommendations and lack of consensus regarding type and timing of prophylaxis in these patients. A systematic literature review was conducted to examine VTE incidence in addition to optimal type and timing of VTE prophylaxis. A detailed search was carried out on Embase, PubMed, and Cochrane Library databases through October 18, 2017, for studies that evaluated venous thromboembolic outcomes, type, and timing of prophylaxis administration among ASD surgery patients who were on VTE prophylaxis. The randomized study was assessed for risk of bias using the Cochrane tool and the observational studies using the Newcastle-Ottawa scale (NOS). The search yielded 1180 studies, and three articles published between 1996 and 2008 met the inclusion criteria. There were 583 surgeries performed on 537 patients with a mean age ranging from 45 to 52 years. Females dominated the study with percentages ranging from 60 to 94% in the different study populations. VTE prophylaxis was initiated before surgery in 87.7% patients and intraoperatively in 12.3% patients. VTE incidence ranged between 0 and 9.1% among the studies. VTE can occur after ASD surgery regardless of the type of prophylaxis, and incidence may be higher when mechanical prophylaxis alone is initiated intraoperatively. Further studies to examine VTE prophylaxis in patients undergoing ASD surgery should be considered.",0
https://doi.org/10.1016/j.sleep.2019.12.015,Predictors of adherence to positive airway pressure therapy in children: a systematic review and meta-analysis,"Abstract Background While positive airway pressure (PAP) is effective for treating sleep-disordered breathing (SDB) in children, adherence is poor. Studies evaluating predictors of PAP adherence have inconsistent findings, and no rigorous reviews have been conducted. This systematic review aims to summarize the literature on predictors of PAP therapy adherence in children. Methods Studies evaluating baseline predictors of PAP therapy adherence in children (≤20 years) with SDB were included. We searched MEDLINE, Embase, CENTRAL, CINAHL, Clinicaltrials.gov , and the last four years of conference abstracts. Results were described narratively, with random-effects meta-analyses performed where feasible. Risk of bias and confidence in the evidence were assessed. Results We identified 50 factors evaluated across 28 studies (21 full text articles, seven abstracts). The highest rates of PAP therapy adherence were most consistently found with female sex, younger age, Caucasian race, higher maternal education, greater baseline apnea-hypopnea index (AHI), and presence of developmental delay. Pooled estimates included odds ratios of 1.48 (95%CI: 0.75–2.93) favoring female sex, 1.26 (95%CI: 0.68–2.36) favoring Caucasian race, and a mean difference in AHI of 4.32 (95%CI: −0.61-9.26) events/hour between adherent and non-adherent groups. There was low quality evidence to suggest that psychosocial factors like health cognitions and family environment may predict adherence. Conclusion In this novel systematic review, we identified several factors associated with increased odds of PAP therapy adherence in children. These findings may help guide clinicians to identify and support children less likely to adhere to PAP therapy and should be considered when developing interventions to improve adherence.",0

Objective This study aimed to systematically evaluate mHealth interventions used in pregnancy in high-income countries and their effects on maternal health behaviors and maternal-fetal health outcomes. Methods This systematic review identified studies published between January 1, 2000, and November 30, 2018, in MEDLINE via PubMed, Cochrane Library, EMBASE, CINAHL, PsycINFO, Web of Science, and gray literature. Studies were eligible for inclusion if they included only pregnant women in high-income countries and evaluated stand-alone mobile phone interventions intended to promote healthy maternal beliefs, behaviors, and/or maternal-fetal health outcomes. Two researchers independently reviewed and categorized aspects of full-text articles, including source, study design, intervention and control, duration, participant age, attrition rate, main outcomes, and risk of bias. Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines were followed, and the study was registered in PROSPERO before initiation. Results Of the 2225 records examined, 28 studies were included and categorized into 4 themes: (1) gestational weight gain, obesity and physical activity (n=9); (2) smoking cessation (n=9); (3) influenza vaccination (n=2); and (4) general prenatal health, preventive strategies, and miscellaneous topics (n=8). Reported sample sizes ranged from 16 to 5243 with a median of 91. Most studies were performed in the United States (18/28, 64%) and were randomized controlled trials (21/28, 75%). All participants in the included studies were pregnant at the time of study initiation. Overall, 14% (4/28) of studies showed association between intervention use and improved health outcomes; all 4 studies focused on healthy gestational weight. Among those, 3 studies showed intervention use was associated with less overall gestational weight gain. These 3 studies involved interventions with text messaging or an app in combination with another communication strategy (Facebook or email). Regarding smoking cessation, influenza vaccination, and miscellaneous topics, there was some evidence of positive effects on health behaviors and beliefs, but very limited correlation with improved health outcomes. Data and interventions were heterogeneous, precluding a meta-analysis. Conclusions In high-income countries, utilization of mobile phone–based health behavior interventions in pregnancy demonstrates some correlation with positive beliefs, behaviors, and health outcomes. More effective interventions are multimodal in terms of features and tend to focus on healthy gestational weight gain.",0

Determinants of nutrition transition in sub-Saharan Africa are presently not well understood. The objective of this review was to synthesise available data on determinants of dietary and physical activity behaviours among women of reproductive age in urban sub-Saharan Africa according to the socio-ecological framework. We searched MEDLINE, Embase, Scopus, Web of Science and bibliographies of included articles for qualitative, observational and randomised controlled studies published in English from January 2000 to September 2018. Studies conducted within general populations of women aged 18–49 years were included. Searches were according to a predefined protocol published on PROSPERO (ID = CRD42018108532). Two reviewers independently screened identified studies. From a total of 9853 unique references, twenty-three studies were retained and were mainly from South and West Africa. No rigorous designed quantitative study was identified. Hence, data synthesis was narrative. Notable determinants of dietary behaviour included: convenience, finances, social network, food skills and knowledge gaps, food deserts and culture. Cultural beliefs include strong relationship between high social status and weight gain, energy-dense confectionery, salt or fat-rich foods. Physical activity is influenced by the fast-changing transport environment and cultural beliefs which instigate unfavourable gender stereotypes. Studies with rigorous qualitative and quantitative designs are required to validate and develop the proposed frameworks further, especially within East Africa. Nevertheless, available insights suggest a need for comprehensive skill-based interventions focusing on socio-cultural misconceptions and financial limitations.",0

The effects and complications of stereotactic radiosurgery have not been extensively studied.We aimed to reveal the effect of stereotactic radiosurgery on residual and recurrent adenomas.A systematic review of the literature in the MEDLINE/PubMed, Cochrane Central Database, and Google Scholar was conducted using the criteria of the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses statement. The search was structured according to the PICOT (i.e., Participants, types of Interventions, Comparator between the treatments, types of Outcome measures, and Follow-up [Time of duration]) strategy. The methodologic quality assessment (risk of bias) was performed according to the Methodological Index for Non-Randomized Studies scale. The studies were grouped and analyzed after data extraction using the software ""R"".Twenty-six articles including 2315 patients were analyzed, with an average follow-up duration of 57.8 months and mean radiation marginal dose of 19.6 Gy. The overall tumor control rate was 95%, tumor reduction rate was 46%, and hormonal control rate was 67%. The side effects were evaluated.Stereotactic radiosurgery was efficient in residual or recurrence tumor control, with few side effects, and is recommended for treating residual or recurrent tumors, both secreting and nonsecreting tumors. A limitation of this study is that there were no randomized trials included in the synthesis.",0

Identification of patients that may benefit from implantable cardioverter-defibrillator implantation remains challenging. In this study, we aimed to determine predictors of sustained ventricular arrhythmias in patients with DCM. Methods and results We searched MEDLINE/Embase for studies describing predictors of sustained ventricular arrhythmias in patients with DCM. Quality and bias were assessed using the Quality in Prognostic Studies tool, articles with high risk of bias in ≥2 areas were excluded. Unadjusted hazard ratios (HRs) of uniformly defined predictors were pooled, while all other predictors were evaluated in a systematic review. We included 55 studies (11 451 patients and 3.7 ± 2.3 years follow-up). Crude annual event rate was 4.5%. Younger age [HR 0.82; 95% CI (0.74-1.00)], hypertension [HR 1.95; 95% CI (1.26-3.00)], prior sustained ventricular arrhythmia [HR 4.15; 95% CI (1.32-13.02)], left ventricular ejection fraction on ultrasound [HR 1.45; 95% CI (1.19-1.78)], left ventricular dilatation (HR 1.10), and presence of late gadolinium enhancement [HR 5.55; 95% CI (4.02-7.67)] were associated with arrhythmic outcome in pooled analyses. Prior non-sustained ventricular arrhythmia and several genotypes [mutations in Phospholamban (PLN), Lamin A/C (LMNA), and Filamin-C (FLNC)] were associated with arrhythmic outcome in non-pooled analyses. Quality of evidence was moderate, and heterogeneity among studies was moderate to high. Conclusions In patients with DCM, the annual event rate of sustained ventricular arrhythmias is approximately 4.5%. This risk is considerably higher in younger patients with hypertension, prior (non-)sustained ventricular arrhythmia, decreased left ventricular ejection fraction, left ventricular dilatation, late gadolinium enhancement, and genetic mutations (PLN, LMNA, and FLNC). These results may help determine appropriate candidates for implantable cardioverter-defibrillator implantation.",0

Our aim was to investigate the changes of immune biomarkers in PTSD. Methods : Literatures investigating the changes of immune markers in PTSD published in English were systematically searched through PubMed, Embase and Web of Science. We conducted random effects meta-analyses relating PTSD to immune biomarker concentrations and using subgroup analyses to resolve heterogeneity. Results : A total of 2606 articles were screened and 42 samples were included by the systematic review. The levels of interleukin-1β (IL-1β, P = 0.01), IL-2 (P = 0.006), IL-6 (P = 0.0002), interferon-γ (IFN-γ, P = 0.004), tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α, P = 0.004), C-reactive protein (CRP, P = 0.0003) and white blood cell (WBC, P = 0.01) were higher in PTSD than healthy controls (HC). Subgroup meta-analyses for psychotropic medication showed the levels of IL-1β and IL-2 were not increased in the PTSD. Subgroup meta-analyses for whether HC exposed to trauma showed the levels of IL-1β and IL-6 were not increased in the PTSD. Egger´s test revealed there was no publication bias. However, there was significant heterogeneity across studies for immune markers other than for WBC (P = 0.14, I2 = 45%). Subgroup analyses based on sex, HC exposed to trauma, PTSD comorbid major depressive disorder, PTSD on psychotropic medications partially or completely resolved heterogeneity for some immune biomarkers. Conclusion : This meta-analysis provides evidence for elevation of IFN-γ, TNF-α, CRP, and WBC in PTSD.",0

An immunosuppressive phenotype often characterizes pancreatic cancer with a low degree of immune cell infiltration. Cytotoxic CD8+ T cell infiltration in tumours is found to be the best predictive variable for response to immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy, emphasizing the importance of investigating TILs in pancreatic cancer, especially focussing on CD8+ T cells.Here, we systematically review the literature and perform meta-analyses to examine the prognostic value of TILs in human pancreatic ductal adenocarcinomas (PDAC). Secondarily, we review the literature regarding the histological localization of TILs and the impact on survival in PDAC.A literature search was conducted on PubMed, Embase, The Cochrane Library and Web of Science. Studies examining patients with PDAC and the impact of high vs. low infiltration of immune cells on long-term oncological survival measures were included. Time-to-event meta-analysis and frequency analysis were conducted using a random effects model. The risk of bias was assessed using the Newcastle-Ottowa Scale. Quality of the cumulative evidence was evaluated using the GRADE approach for prognostic studies.In total, 1971 articles were screened, of which 43 studies were included in the systematic review and 39 in the meta-analysis. High infiltration of CD8+ lymphocytes was significantly associated with improved overall survival (OS) [hazard ratio (HR) = 0.58, 95% confidence intervals (CIs): 0.50-0.68], disease-free survival (DFS) [HR = 0.64, 95% CI: 0.52-0.78], progression-free survival [HR = 0.66, 95% CI: 0.51-0.86] and cancer-specific survival [HR = 0.56, 95% CI: 0.32-0.99]. A high infiltration of CD3+ T cells was correlated with increased OS [HR = 0.58, 95% CI: 0.50-0.68] and DFS [HR = 0.74, 95% CI: 0.38-1.43]. Infiltration of CD4+ lymphocytes was associated with improved 12-months OS [risk ratio = 0.59, 95% CI: 0.35-0.99] and DFS [risk ratio = 0.68, 95% CI: 0.53-0.88]. High expression of FoxP3+ lymphocytes was associated with poor OS [HR = 1.48, 95% CI: 1.20-1.83]. The greatest impact on survival was observed in the CD8+ T cell and OS group, when infiltration was located to the tumour centre [HR = 0.53, 95% CI: 0.45-0.63]. However, subgroup analysis on the impact of the histological location of infiltration revealed no significant differences between the subgroups (tumour centre, invasive margin, stroma and all locations) in any of the examined cell types and outcomes.Subsets of TILs, especially CD3+, CD8+ and FoxP3+ T cells are strongly associated with long-term oncological outcomes in patients with PDAC. To our knowledge, this is the first systematic review and meta-analysis on the prognostic value of TILs in pancreatic cancer.",0

In accordance with Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA), we searched 8 databases (1994–2018) to identify relevant articles on factors associated with youth psychiatric readmission. Selected articles addressed one or more factors associated with psychiatric readmission for children and adolescents (≤21 years of age) admitted to a psychiatric hospital in the United States for a primary mental health diagnosis. Two authors independently reviewed article abstracts, titles, and text. Of 7903 retrieved articles, 30 studies met inclusion criteria. Analyzed variables were categorized according to child demographic and clinical characteristics; family, provider, and community characteristics; and treatment and aftercare characteristics. Available studies were markedly heterogeneous in methodology and outcomes. Factors associated with an increased risk of readmission included greater symptom severity, clinical diagnoses such as psychosis and affective disorders, suicidal behavior and self-injury, poor family functioning, and longer lengths of index hospital stay. Controlled trials of interventions to improve care and reduce recidivism for psychiatrically hospitalized youth are needed. Future research will benefit from a guiding theoretical framework, more representative samples, and standardized exposure/outcome measures.",0

Study design The research was conducted using MEDLINE, EMBASE, Scopus, Web of Sciences, Cochrane Database, and ClinicalTrial.gov as electronic databases. The articles were identified with the use of a combination of the relevant heading term, key words, and word variants for: “optimism” or “happiness” and “pregnancy” or “obstetrical outcomes”, from the inception of each database to June 2019. Review of articles also included the abstracts of all references retrieved from the search. Randomized, cohort, case-control, or case series were all accepted study designs. Only studies reporting obstetrical outcomes in women undergone LOT-R to assess dispositional optimism during pregnancy were included. Obstetrical outcomes included preterm birth, pre-eclampsia and small for gestational age fetuses. All analyses were carried out using the random effects model. Dichotomous variables were analyzed using the odds ratio (OR) with a 95 % confidence interval (95 % CI). No continuous variables were compared in the analysis. Significance level was set at P Results Two prospective cohort studies, including 3,570 pregnancies undergone LOT-R - mostly during the second trimester - were included in the systematic review. Out of the 3,570 pregnancies included, 411 were in the lowest quartile of optimism, according to LOT-R score. Dispositional optimism showed a trend towards lower incidence of preterm birth (7.6 % vs 9.7 %; OR 0.76, CI 0.53–1.09); no difference between women at higher levels and women in the lowest quartile of optimism was found in preeclampsia and small for gestational age. Women at higher levels of dispositional optimism were significantly associated with: age ≥ 30 years; marriage or “marriage-like status”; lower rates of public assistance and smoking; white ethnicity; higher rates of higher education. Conclusion There are limited data on optimism and obstetric outcomes. Higher levels of optimism, evaluated by the LOT-R tool in two studies, are associated with a non-significant decrease in preterm birth.",0

Since accurate and reproducible measures are prerequisites for robust results, choosing an acceptable measure with strong psychometric properties to assess financial toxicity is essential. However, a description of the psychometric properties of existing measures is still lacking. The aim of this study is to apply COnsensus-based Standards for the selection of health Measurement INstruments (COSMIN) methodology to systematically review the content and structural validity of patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs) of financial toxicity for cancer survivors. Methods and analysis PubMed/Medline, Medline (Ovid), Embase (Ovid), CINAHL (EBSCO), Web of Science, ProQuest Dissertations and Theses, and Cochrane Library (Wiley) will be comprehensively searched from database inception to 15 November 2019. Studies that report the measurement properties of PROMs assessing financial toxicity for cancer survivors will be included. The evaluation of measurement properties, data extraction and data synthesis will be conducted according to the COSMIN methodology. Ethics and dissemination No individual data are involved in this systematic review. The results will be disseminated to a clinical audience and policy-makers though peer-reviewed journals and conferences and will support researchers in choosing the best measure to evaluate the financial toxicity of cancer survivors.",0
https://doi.org/10.3390/foods9040463,Food Waste in the Countries of the Gulf Cooperation Council: A Systematic Review,"Food waste (FW) is a critical challenge in the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC). This paper analyzes research dealing with food waste in the GCC countries (viz. Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates). It draws upon a systematic review performed on Scopus in January 2020. The paper covers both bibliometrics (e.g., authors, affiliations, journals) and research topics (e.g., causes, food supply chain stages, extent and quantity, food security, economic impacts, environmental implications, management strategies). A main finding of the review is the scarcity of data on FW in the GCC in general and in Kuwait, Oman, and Bahrain in particular. Most of the selected articles address FW reuse and recycling (e.g., waste-to-energy conversion, compost production). Indeed, other FW management strategies, such as reduction/prevention and redistribution, are overlooked. The systematic review highlights that further research on FW in the GCC is highly needed with a focus on the identified research gaps such as causes and drivers, trends, magnitude and extent, environmental and economic impacts, along with implications of food wastage in terms of food security. Since food wastage is a common issue for all GCC countries, these research gaps should be addressed in a shared regional research agenda.",0

Using Covidence, three authors screened abstracts and two screened full articles for inclusion.Two authors extracted data from each article and the data were analyzed using a descriptive approach. A total of 83 studies met inclusion criteria and were analyzed. Seventy-eight of 83 studies examined socioeconomic position or individual factors as predictors, demonstrating evidence of associations between minority race and ethnicity (58/67 studies with positive findings), public or no insurance coverage (21/30), and lower education levels (8/12), and increased incidence of maternal death and severe maternal morbidity. Only 2 of 83 studies investigated associations between these outcomes and socioeconomic, political, and cultural context (eg, public policy), and 20 of 83 studies investigated material and physical circumstances (eg, neighborhood environment, segregation), limiting the diversity of social determinants of health studied as well as evaluation of such evidence.Empirical studies provide evidence for the role of race and ethnicity, insurance, and education in pregnancy-related mortality and severe maternal morbidity risk, although many other important social determinants, including mechanisms of effect, remain to be studied in greater depth.PROSPERO, CRD42018102415.",0
https://doi.org/10.1186/s12940-020-00582-1,A systematic review and meta-analysis of haematological malignancies in residents living near petrochemical facilities,"Abstract Background The petrochemical industry is a major source of hazardous and toxic air pollutants that are recognised to have mutagenic and carcinogenic properties. A wealth of occupational epidemiology literature exists around the petrochemical industry, with adverse haematological effects identified in employees exposed to ‘low’ concentrations of aromatic hydrocarbons (benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, and xylene). Releases from the petrochemical industry are also thought to increase the risk of cancer incidence in fenceline communities. However, this emerging and at times inconclusive evidence base remains fragmented. The present study’s aim was to conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis of epidemiological studies investigating the association between incidences of haematological malignancy and residential exposure to the petrochemical industry. Methods Epidemiological studies reporting the risk of haematological malignancies (Leukaemia, Hodgkin’s lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma, and Multiple myeloma) were included where the following criteria were met: (i) Cancer incidence is diagnosed by a medical professional and coded in accordance to the International Classification of Diseases; (ii) A clear definition of fenceline communities is provided, indicating the proximity between exposed residents and petrochemical activities; and (iii) Exposure is representative of normal operating conditions, not emergency events. Two investigators independently extracted information on study characteristics and outcomes in accordance with PRISMA and MOOSE guidelines. Relative risks and their 95% confidence intervals were pooled across studies for the four categories of haematological malignancy, using a random effects meta-analysis. Results The systematic review identified 16 unique studies, which collectively record the incidence of haematological malignancies across 187,585 residents living close to a petrochemical operation. Residents from fenceline communities, less than 5 km from a petrochemical facility (refinery or manufacturer of commercial chemicals), had a 30% higher risk of developing Leukaemia than residents from communities with no petrochemical activity. Meanwhile, the association between exposure and rarer forms of haematological malignancy remains uncertain, with further research required. Conclusions The risk of developing Leukaemia appears higher in individuals living near a petrochemical facility. This highlights the need for further policy to regulate the release of carcinogens by industry. Graphical abstract",1

We carried out a systematic review and meta-analysis to evaluate the value of LLND for the patients with rectal cancer. To collect clinical studies for the comparison of LLND and non-LLND in patients with rectal cancer, PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library, Web of Science, and Google Scholar databases were searched from inception to 2019.A total of 26 studies, including 6865 patients were enrolled. Data processing and statistical analyses were performed using Stata V.15.0 software and Review Manager 5.3 software. Outcome measures included the 5-year survival rate, recurrence rate, perioperative outcomes, urinary function, and male sexual function. Regarding efficacy, our meta-analysis results showed no difference in 5-year disease-free survival rate and local recurrences between the two groups, the Hazard Ratio (HR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) was1.07 and 0.89 to 1.28 (P = 0.496),and the Odds Ratio(OR) and 95% CI were 0.90 and 0.76 to 1.06 (P = 0.208), respectively. Concerning safety, the incidence of urinary dysfunction and male sexual dysfunction was significantly increased in the LLND group (OR = 2.14, 95%CI = 1.21-3.79, P = 0.009), and (OR = 4.19, 95%CI = 1.55-11.33, P = 0.005), respectively. In conclusion, LLND did not improve the long-term prognosis of patients with rectal cancer, and was associated with increased urinary dysfunction and male sexual dysfunction.",0

In cancer patients treated with immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs), concomitant exposure to ABs may impair the efficacy of ICIs and lead to a poorer outcome compared to AB non-users. We report here the results of a meta-analysis evaluating the effects of ABs on the outcome of patients with solid tumours treated with ICIs. PubMed, the Cochrane Library and Embase were searched from inception until September 2019 for observational or prospective studies reporting the prognoses of adult patients with cancer treated with ICIs and with or without ABs. Overall survival (OS) was the primary endpoint, and progression-free survival (PFS) was the secondary endpoint. The effect size was reported as hazard ratios (HRs) with a 95% confidence interval (CI) and an HR &gt; 1 associated with a worse outcome in ABs users compared to AB non-users. Fifteen publications were retrieved for a total of 2363 patients. In the main analysis (n = 15 studies reporting data), OS was reduced in patients exposed to ABs before or during treatment with ICIs (HR = 2.07, 95%CI 1.51–2.84; p &lt; 0.01). Similarly, PFS was inferior in AB users in n = 13 studies with data available (HR = 1.53, 95%CI 1.22–1.93; p &lt; 0.01). In cancer patients treated with ICIs, AB use significantly reduced OS and PFS.

Although conceptual links between self-compassion and trauma are apparent, a review has not been completed to examine whether this association is supported by empirical research findings. To systematically summarize knowledge on the association between trauma and/or posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and self-compassion. Searches were conducted in PsycINFO, PubMed, Ovid Medline, Web of Science, Embase, and PILOTS databases, and papers reporting a direct analysis on the relationship between these constructs were identified. The search yielded 35 studies meeting inclusion criteria. Despite considerable heterogeneity in study design, sample, measurement, and trauma type, there was consistent evidence to suggest that increased self-compassion is associated with less PTSD symptomatology and some evidence to suggest that reduced fear of self-compassion is associated with less PTSD symptomatology. There was tentative evidence to suggest that interventions based, in part or whole, on a self-compassion model potentially reduce PTSD symptoms. Although findings are positive for the association between increased self-compassion and reduced PTSD symptoms, the precise mechanism of these protective effects is unknown. Prospective and longitudinal studies would be beneficial in clarifying this. The review also highlighted the variability in what is and should be referred to as trauma exposure, indicating the need for further research to clarify the concept.",0

Due to the different chemotherapeutic drugs used in the IC and CCRT, the results remain controversial. Methods PubMed, EMBASE, Web of Science, and Cochrane Library databases were systematically retrieved to search potentially eligible clinical trials up to Sep 11, 2019. Eligible studies were registered and prospective randomized controlled clinical trials. Results From 526 records, nine articles including seven randomized controlled clinical trials were eligible, with a total of 2311 locoregional advanced NPC patients. IC + CCRT had significantly lower risks of death (3-year hazard ratio [HR]: 0.70, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.55–0.89, p = 0.003; 5-year HR: 0.77, 95% CI 0.62–0.94, p = 0.01), disease progression (3-year HR: 0.67, 95% CI 0.55–0.80, p &lt; 0.001; 5-year HR: 0.70, 95% CI 0.58–0.83, p &lt; 0.0001), distant metastasis (3-year HR: 0.58, 95% CI 0.45–0.74, p &lt; 0.0001; 5-year HR: 0.69, 95% CI 0.55–0.87, p = 0.001) and locoregional relapse (3-year HR: 0.69, 95% CI 0.50–0.95, p = 0.02; 5-year HR: 0.66, 95% CI 0.51–0.86, p = 0.002) than CCRT. Compared with CCRT, IC + CCRT showed higher relative risks of grade 3 or more neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, nausea, vomiting and hepatotoxicity throughout the course of treatment, and higher relative risks of grade ≥ 3 thrombocytopenia and vomiting during CCRT. Conclusion IC combined with CCRT significantly improved the survival in locoregional advanced NPC patients. Moreover, toxicities were well tolerated during IC and CCRT. Further clinical trials are warranted to confirm the optimal induction chemotherapeutic regimen in the future.",0

Random-effects models were used to pool childbirth hazard ratios, relative risks, rate ratios and odds ratios, and 95% confidence intervals were estimated; 18 eligible studies were identified. Childbirth chances were significantly reduced in women with a history of bone cancer (HR 0.86, 95% CI 0.77 to 0.97; I<sup>2</sup> = 0%; <i>P</i> = 0.02 (two studies); RaR 0.76, 95% CI 0.61 to 0.95; I<sup>2</sup> = 69%; <i>P</i> = 0.01 (two studies); breast cancer (HR 0.74, 95% CI 0.61 to 0.90 (one study); RaR 0.51, 95% CI 0.47 to 0.57; I<sup>2</sup> = 0%; <i>P</i> < 0.00001 (two studies); brain cancer (HR 0.61, 95% CI 0.51 to 0.72; I<sup>2</sup> = 14%; <i>P</i> < 0.00001 (three studies); RR 0.62, 95% CI 0.42 to 0.91 (one study); RaR 0.44, 95% CI 0.33 to 0.60; I<sup>2</sup> = 95%; <i>P</i> < 0.00001 (four studies); OR 0.49, 95% CI 0.40 to 0.60 (one study); and kidney cancer (RR 0.66, 95% CI 0.43 to 0.98 (one study); RaR 0.69, 95% CI 0.61 to 0.78 (one study). Reproductive chances in women survivors of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, melanoma and thyroid cancer were unaffected. Women with a history of bone, breast, brain or kidney cancer have reduced chances of childbirth. Thyroid cancer, melanoma and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma survivors can be reassured.",0

https://doi.org/10.1007/s10926-020-09879-x,A Systematic Review of Workplace Interventions to Rehabilitate Musculoskeletal Disorders Among Employees with Physical Demanding Work,"Abstract Purpose This systematic review investigates the effectiveness of workplace interventions to rehabilitate musculoskeletal disorders (MSDs) among employees with physically demanding work. Methods A systematic search was conducted in bibliographic databases including PubMed and Web of Science Core Collection for English articles published from 1998 to 2018. The PICO strategy guided the assessment of study relevance and the bibliographical search for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and non-RCTs in which (1) participants were adult workers with physically demanding work and MSD (including specific and non-specific MSD and musculoskeletal pain, symptoms, and discomfort), (2) interventions were initiated and/or carried out at the workplace, (3) a comparison group was included, and (4) a measure of MSD was reported (including musculoskeletal pain, symptoms, prevalence or discomfort). The quality assessment and evidence synthesis adhered to the guidelines developed by the Institute for Work &amp; Health (Toronto, Canada) focusing on developing practical recommendations for stakeholders. Relevant stakeholders were engaged in the review process. Results Level of evidence from 54 high and medium quality studies showed moderate evidence of a positive effect of physical exercise. Within this domain, there was strong evidence of a positive effect of workplace strength training. There was limited evidence for ergonomics and strong evidence for no benefit of participatory ergonomics, multifaceted interventions, and stress management. No intervention domains were associated with “negative effects”. Conclusions The evidence synthesis recommends that implementing strength training at the workplace can reduce MSD among workers with physically demanding work. In regard to workplace ergonomics, there was not enough evidence from the scientific literature to guide current practices. Based on the scientific literature, participatory ergonomics and multifaceted workplace interventions seem to have no beneficial effect on reducing MSD among this group of workers. As these interventional domains were very heterogeneous, it should also be recognized that general conclusions about their effectiveness should be done with care.

All studies had diagnosed depression with validated tools in patients without diagnosed coronary artery disease. The Bradford Hill criteria of cause-effect association was consistently fulfilled by those studies which achieved statistical significance and further showed incremental strength of association with one or more of the following attributes: (1) prospective cohort study, met cause-effect criteria of ""temporality""; (2) relatively severe and/or longer period of depression, met cause-effect criteria of ""dose-response""; (3) depression with predominantly somatic symptoms cluster, met cause-effect criteria of ""scientific plausibility""; (4) multiethnic larger sample, met cause-effect criteria of ""population equivalence""; and (5) multicenter study, met criteria of ""environmental equivalence."" Our results show that there is a significant association of depression with coronary atherosclerosis at its subclinical stages.",0

A Systematic Review,"Abstract Background Many studies assume that the serologic correlate of protection from measles disease is 120 mIU/mL. We systematically reviewed the literature to examine the evidence supporting this correlate of protection. Methods We searched peer-reviewed and gray literature for articles reporting a measles correlate of protection. We excluded studies focusing on special populations, infants aged &amp;lt;9 months, and those using animal models or nonstandard vaccines or administration routes. We extracted and synthesized data from full-text articles that met inclusion criteria. Results We screened 14 778 articles and included 5 studies in our review. The studies reported either preexposure antibody concentrations of individuals along with a description of symptoms postexposure, or the proportion of measles cases that had preexposure antibody concentrations above a threshold of immunity specified by the authors. Some studies also described secondary antibody responses upon exposure. The variation in laboratory methods between studies made comparisons difficult. Some of the studies that assumed 120 mIU/mL as a correlate of protection identified symptomatic individuals with preexposure titers exceeding this threshold. Conclusions Our findings underscore the scant data upon which the commonly used 120 mIU/mL measles threshold of protection is based, suggesting that further work is required to characterize the measles immunity threshold.",0

We examined the associations between different threshold elevations of these peptide levels and clinical outcomes in patients with ESKD.Systematic review and meta-analysis.We searched MEDLINE and EMBASE (through September 2019) for observational studies of adults with ESKD (estimated glomerular filtration rate≤15mL/min/1.73m2 or receiving maintenance dialysis).Studies that reported NT-proBNP or BNP levels and future CV events, CV mortality, or all-cause mortality.Cohort characteristics and measures of risk associated with study-specified peptide thresholds.Hazard ratios (HRs) for clinical outcomes associated with different NT-proBNP and BNP ranges were categorized into common thresholds and pooled using random-effects meta-analysis.We identified 61 studies for inclusion in our review (19,688 people). 49 provided sufficient detail for inclusion in meta-analysis. Pooled unadjusted HRs for CV mortality were progressively greater for greater thresholds of NT-proBNP, from 1.45 (95% CI, 0.91-2.32) for levels>2,000pg/mL to 5.95 (95% CI, 4.23-8.37) for levels>15,000pg/mL. Risk for all-cause mortality was significantly higher at all NT-proBNP thresholds ranging from> 1,000 to> 20,000pg/mL (HR range, 1.53-4.00). BNP levels>550pg/mL were associated with increased risk for CV mortality (HR, 2.54; 95% CI, 1.49-4.33), while the risks for all-cause mortality were 2.04 (95% CI, 0.82-5.12) at BNP levels>100pg/mL and 2.97 (95% CI, 2.21-3.98) at BNP levels>550pg/mL. Adjusted analyses demonstrated similarly greater risks for CV and all-cause mortality with greater NT-proBNP concentrations.Incomplete outcome reporting and risk for outcome reporting bias. Estimation of risk for CV events for specific thresholds of both peptides were limited by poor precision.ESKD-specific NT-proBNP and BNP level thresholds of elevation are associated with increased risk for CV and all-cause mortality. This information may help guide interpretation of NT-proBNP and BNP levels in patients with ESKD.",0
https://doi.org/10.1186/s40249-020-00644-z,Changes in smoking patterns after HIV diagnosis or antiretroviral treatment initiation: a global systematic review and meta-analysis,"Abstract Background Tobacco consumption is more life-threatening in people living with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) than within the general population; therefore, people living with HIV (PLWH) should be highly motivated to take action towards quitting smoking at or after HIV diagnosis. The aim of this systematic review with meta-analysis was to investigate changes in smoking habits among PLWH over time. Main text We considered prospective and retrospective cohort studies including PLWH aged 15 years and above, which have measured the prevalence of tobacco smoking (current, former or never) at study initiation and completion, and published between January 1, 2000 and April 15, 2018 without language or geographical restriction. We searched PubMed, EMBASE, Web of Science, Africa Journal Online, and Global Index Medicus. We used a random-effects model to pool data. Nine studies were included. The proportion of current and former smokers decreased slightly over time, around 2.5 and 3.8%, respectively. However, the proportion of never smokers decreased sharply by 22.5%, and there were 2.1 and 1.5% PLWH who shifted from never and former smoking to current smoking, respectively. On the other hand, 10.5% PLWH shifted from current to former smoking, 7.1% tried to quit tobacco consumption but failed, and 10.1% stayed in the “never smoking” category over time. Conclusions PLWH seem not to change positively their smoking habits towards quitting tobacco consumption. There is urgent need to increase actions aimed at helping this vulnerable population to quit tobacco consumption, including individually tailored therapeutic education, psychosocial and pharmacologic supports.",0
https://doi.org/10.21037/tlcr.2020.01.18,Is lung stereotactic ablative radiotherapy safe after pneumonectomy?—a systematic review,"Patients treated with surgery for lung cancer are at risk of second primary lung cancers (SPLCs), which when localized, may be amenable to radical treatment. Treatment options, however, are limited due to reduced cardiopulmonary reserve and competing mortality risks. The aim of this study was to perform a systematic review of publications examining treatment planning considerations, clinical outcomes, and toxicity rates of stereotactic ablative radiotherapy (SABR) in patients who have previously undergone pneumonectomy. A systematic review of the literature was conducted in accordance with PRISMA guidelines using PubMed and EMBASE from inception to July 2018. Articles were limited to those published in the English language. Non-review articles with patients who received exclusively lung SABR post-pneumonectomy were included. Two reviewers independently performed abstract and full-text review, with discrepancies settled by a third reviewer. Of the 215 articles identified by the initial search, 6 articles comprising 53 patients who received lung SABR post-pneumonectomy met inclusion criteria. The mean age was 68, and most patients were male (73.7%). The mean time to pneumonectomy was 6.5 years. The mean biologically effective dose was 115 Gy, and the most common dose fractionation schemes were 54 Gy in 3 fractions, 48 Gy in 4 fractions, and 50 Gy in 5 fractions. The mean follow-up was 25.4 months. The mean 1-year overall survival and 2-year local control rates were 80.6% and 89.4%. Grade 3 or higher toxicity was reported in 13.2% of patients. SABR appears to be a safe and feasible option for SPLCs in patients with prior pneumonectomy. Multi-institutional and/or prospective studies would be helpful to determine the true risk and appropriateness of SABR in this high-risk patient population.",0
https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijrobp.2020.04.011,"A Systematic Review of Contouring Guidelines in Radiation Oncology: Analysis of Frequency, Methodology, and Delivery of Consensus Recommendations","Purpose Clinical trials have described variation in radiation therapy plan quality, of which contour delineation is a key component, and linked this to inferior patient outcomes. In response, consensus guidelines have been developed to standardize contour delineation. This investigation assesses trends in contouring guidelines and examines the methodologies used to generate and deliver recommendations. Methods and Materials We conducted a literature search for contouring guidelines published after 1995. Of 11,124 citations, 332 were identified for full-text review to determine inclusion. We abstracted articles for the intent of the consensus process, key elements of the methodology, and mode of information delivery. A Fisher exact test was used to identify elements that differed among the guidelines generated for clinical trials and routine care. Results Overall, 142 guidelines were included, of which 16 (11%) were developed for a clinical trial. There was an increase in guideline publication over time (0 from 1995-1999 vs 65 from 2015- 2019; P = .03), particularly among recommendations for stereotactic radiation and brachytherapy. The most common disease sites were head and neck (24%), gastrointestinal (12%), and gynecologic (12%). Methods used to develop recommendations included literature review (50%) and image-based methods (45%). Panels included a median of 10 physicians (interquartile range, 7-16); 70% of panels represented multidisciplinary expertise. Guidelines developed for a clinical trial were more likely to include an image-based approach, with quantitative analysis of contours submitted by the panel members and to publish a full set of image-based recommendations (P Conclusions This review highlights an increase in consensus contouring recommendations over time. Guidelines focus on disease sites, such as head and neck, with evidence supporting a correlation between treatment planning and patient outcomes, although variation exists in the approach to the consensus process. Elements that may improve guideline acceptance (ie, image-based consensus contour analysis) and usability (ie, inclusion of a full image set) are more common in guidelines developed for clinical trials.",0

We searched for studies that examined individual, environmental, and political/cultural correlates of total and domain-specific SB (transport, occupation, leisure, and screen time) in Asian adults published from 2000 onwards in nine scientific databases. Two reviewers independently screened identified references. Following quality assessment of included studies, we performed narrative synthesis that considered differences based on SB measurements, regions, and population characteristics (PROSPERO: CRD42018095268). We identified 13 249 papers of which we included 49, from four regions and 12 countries. Researchers conducted cross-sectional analyses and most relied on SB self-report for SB measurement. Of the 118 correlates studied, the following associations were consistent: higher age, living in an urban area (East Asia), and lower mental health with higher total SB; higher education with higher total and occupational SB; higher income with higher leisure-time SB; higher transit density with higher total SB in older East Asians; and being an unmarried women with higher SB in the Middle East. We encourage more research in non-high-income countries across regions, further exploration of important but neglected correlates using longitudinal designs and qualitative research, and the use of objective instruments to collect SB data.",0
https://doi.org/10.1093/jamia/ocaa013,Serious games for smoking prevention and cessation: A systematic review of game elements and game effects,"Abstract Objective Serious health games might have the potential to prevent tobacco smoking and its health consequences, depending on the inclusion of specific game elements. This review aimed to assess the composition of serious games and their effects on smoking initiation prevention and cessation and behavioral determinants. Materials and Methods We systematically searched MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, and Web of Science for publications that evaluated serious games aimed at changing smoking behavior or behavioral determinants. A taxonomy by King et al was used to classify game elements. Results We identified 15 studies, evaluating 14 unique serious games. All games combined multiple game elements (mean 5.5; range, 3-10). Most frequently used were general and intermittent rewards, theme and genre features, and punishments. Six studies on smoking prevention together assessed 20 determinants and found statistically significant positive effects for 8 determinants (eg, attitude, knowledge, intention). Of 7 studies on smoking cessation, 5 found positive, statistically significant effects on smoking cessation or status. These studies found statistically significant positive effects for 6 of 12 determinants (eg, self-efficacy, attitude, intention). The majority of included studies had poor or fair methodological quality, lacked follow-up measures, and had fixed (as opposed to free, on-demand) play sessions. Conclusions Serious games included multiple types of game elements. The evidence from a number of studies suggests that games may have positive effects on smoking-related outcomes, particularly smoking cessation. However, as most studies had important methodological limitations, stronger designs are needed to demonstrate, quantify, and understand the effects of serious games.",0

The aim of this study, therefore, is to review the available literature on the use of PPE in agricultural pesticide handlers in world regions, and also the factors associated with the use of PPE and pesticide safety practices in farmers and farm workers. Full-text articles published on PubMed, Scopus, and ISI databases between 1999 and 2019 were reviewed and the scientific evidence was evaluated. One hundred and twenty-one articles were eligible for inclusion in this quantitative synthesis: 110 evaluated PPE use in agricultural pesticide handlers, and 23 focused on factors affecting PPE use and pesticide safety practices. Considerable evidence was found to show that the most basic PPE worn among pesticide handlers in all world regions was a long sleeve shirt (66.1%), long sleeve trousers (71.1%), and a hat (47.3%). The lowest basic PPE worn was an apron (8.6%), goggles (24.3%), gloves (40.5%), boots (42.3%), and mask (43.2%). The PPE worn (except for an apron) was proportionally higher in farmers than in farm workers. There is considerable evidence to suggest that the significant determinants associated with PPE use and pesticide safety practices are as follows: (1) demographic factors (i.e. education/literacy level, experience of illness, income); (2) farm structure factors (i.e. farm size); (3) behavioral and psychosocial factors (i.e. contact with pesticides, perceptions, attitudes, awareness, norms and beliefs); and (4) environmental factors (i.e. information about pesticides, access to extension services, training program, and farm organization). Therefore, there is a recognizable need for a life-long education program with training to change the perception and behavior of pesticide handlers sustainably.",0
https://doi.org/10.1186/s12884-020-02901-3,Human Development Index of the maternal country of origin and its relationship with maternal near miss: A systematic review of the literature,"Abstract Background The reduction in maternal mortality worldwide has increased the interest in studying more frequent severe events such as maternal near miss. The Human Development Index is a sociodemographic country-specific variable that includes key human development indicators such as living a long and healthy life, acquiring knowledge, and enjoying a decent standard of living, allowing differentiation between countries. In a globalised environment, it is necessary to study whether the Human Development Index of each patient's country of origin can be associated with the maternal near-miss rate and thus classify the risk of maternal morbidity and mortality. Methods A systematic review of the literature published between 2008 and 2019 was conducted, including all articles that reported data about maternal near miss in their sample of pregnant women, in addition to describing the study countries of their sample population. The Human Development Index of the study country, the maternal near-miss rate, the maternal mortality rate, and other maternal-perinatal variables related to morbidity and mortality were used. Results After the systematic review, eighty two articles from over thirty countries were included, for a total of 3,699,697 live births, 37,191 near miss cases, and 4029 mortality cases. A statistically significant ( p &lt;0.05) inversely proportional relationship was observed between the Human Development Index of the study country and the maternal near-miss and mortality rates. The most common cause of maternal near miss was haemorrhage, with an overall rate of 38.5%, followed by hypertensive disorders of pregnancy (34.2%), sepsis (7.5%), and other undefined causes (20.9%). Conclusions The Human Development Index of the maternal country of origin is a sociodemographic variable allowing differentiation and classification of the risk of maternal mortality and near miss in pregnant women. The most common cause of maternal near miss published in the literature was haemorrhage. Trial registration PROSPERO ID: CRD 42019133464",0
https://doi.org/10.1016/j.tube.2020.101924,Preclinical models to optimize treatment of tuberculous meningitis – A systematic review,"Tuberculous meningitis (TBM) is the most devastating form of TB, resulting in death or neurological disability in up to 50% of patients affected. Treatment is similar to that of pulmonary TB, despite poor cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) penetration of the cornerstone anti-TB drug rifampicin. Considering TBM pathology, it is critical that optimal drug concentrations are reached in the meninges, brain and/or the surrounding CSF. These type of data are difficult to collect in TBM patients. This review aims to identify and describe a preclinical model representative for human TBM which can provide the indispensable data needed for future pharmacological characterization and prioritization of new TBM regimens in the clinical setting. We reviewed existing literature on treatment of TBM in preclinical models: only eight articles, all animal studies, could be identified. None of the animal models completely recapitulated human disease and in most of the animal studies key pharmacokinetic data were missing, making the comparison with human exposure and CNS distribution, and the study of pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic relationships impossible. Another 18 articles were identified using other bacteria to induce meningitis with treatment including anti-TB drugs (predominantly rifampicin, moxifloxacin and levofloxacin). Of these articles the pharmacokinetics, i.e. plasma exposure and CSF:plasma ratios, of TB drugs in meningitis could be evaluated. Exposures (except for levofloxacin) agreed with human exposures and also most CSF:plasma ratios agreed with ratios in humans. Considering the lack of an ideal preclinical pharmacological TBM model, we suggest a combination of 1. basic physicochemical drug data combined with 2. in vitro pharmacokinetic and efficacy data, 3. an animal model with adequate pharmacokinetic sampling, microdialysis or imaging of drug distribution, all as a base for 4. physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) modelling to predict response to TB drugs in treatment of TBM.",0
https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jad.2020.05.063,Negative affect among daily smokers: A systematic review and meta-analysis,"• This paper synthesizes cross-sectional and longitudinal studies on negative affect (NA) and smoking. • The effect size (ES) between NA and smoking was 0.11 (95% CI 0.071–0.15). • The ES in longitudinal studies was more significant compared to cross-sectional studies. • The ES was higher among adolescents than adults. • Based on gender proportion, ES seems higher among males. The ES was higher in light-to-moderate smokers than in moderate-to-heavy smokers. Negative Affect (NA), as a personality trait is a tendency towards experiencing a more negative emotion. The body of research suggests that NA encourages smoking relapse and smoking as a reason for NA reduction, though. The likelihood of this connection does not seem to be bright yet. The present study critically reviews researches to synthesize the existing literature to determine the strength of this linkage. Key-word related research was systematically searched in PubMed, PsychINFO, Science Direct and Google Scholar for studies conducted from 1980 to 2019, followed by, the assessment and selection of retrieved studies based on defined inclusion criteria. A random-effects meta-analysis model was used to examine the prospective relationship between NA and smoking. Meta-regression was also used to dig for possible explanations of heterogeneity. Furthermore a multi-moderators model and sub-group analyses examined the moderating factors. Forty effect-sizes comprising 12 cross-sectional studies, 28 longitudinal studies and 24,913 participants were included in the meta-analysis. The forest plot of the pooled correlation effect size in the random model indicates a significant effect size of the relationship between NA and smoking ( r = 0.11; 95%CI 0.071–0.15, P = 0.001) in the meta-analysis with high heterogeneity ( Q = 473.916; df=39; P = 0.001; I 2 =91.77%). Also, the pooled effect size was obtained as 0.143 (95%CI 0.071–0.214) for light-to-moderate and 0.112 (95%CI 0.057–0.166) for moderate-to-heavy smokers, with the effect size ranging from 0.061 to 0.195 which was significant among all subtypes, though this trend seem higher among adolescents, males, and longitudinal studies than in adults, females, and cross-sectional studies. The review was limited to English articles, and the heterogeneity of the studies were high. These results support the notion that NA was positively and weakly linked to smoking and this linkage is stronger in light-to-moderate smokers, males, and adolescents. Theoretical and clinical implications are discussed with the aim of extending future directions on NA and smoking.",0

Studies reporting measures of validity and reliability of GRS relating to arthroscopic skills were included. Procedural checklists and other assessment tools were excluded.A total of 39 articles met the inclusion criteria. In total, 7 de novo GRS specific for arthroscopic education and 3 pre-existing GRS repurposed 4 times for arthroscopic education were identified in the literature. The 11 GRS were used to assess 1175 surgeons 3890 times. Three GRS tools explicitly defined an arbitrary minimum competency threshold, 6 of 11 tools demonstrated construct validity-the ability to significantly discriminate between groups of differing experience-and 5 of 11 tools assessed inter-rater reliability, but only the Arthroscopic Surgical Skills Evaluation Tool demonstrated excellent inter-rater reliability. The Arthroscopic Surgical Skills Evaluation Tool was validated by 16 articles for a total of 537 surgeons for hip, knee, shoulder, and ankle arthroscopy in both simulated and clinical environments but was found to be invalid in wrist arthroscopy. The Basic Arthroscopic Knee Skill Scoring System was validated by 15 articles for a total of 497 surgeons for knee, hip, and shoulder in both clinical and simulated environments. The remaining 9 GRS were validated by 2 or fewer studies.Overall, GRS have contributed to training, feedback, and formative assessment practices. The GRS reviewed demonstrate both construct and concurrent validity as well as reliability in multiple arthroscopic procedures in multiple joints. Currently, there is sufficient evidence to use GRS as a feedback tool. However, there is insufficient evidence for its use in high-stakes examinations or as a minimum competency assessment.Level III, systematic review of level I to III studies.",0

This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to assess the association between dietary intake and the risk of mortality among patients with esophageal cancer. Methods Six electronic databases (PubMed, Web of Science, OVID, ProQuest, CNKI and Wanfang) were searched for studies published up to Oct. 2019 that examined the association between dietary intake and all-cause mortality, esophageal cancer-specific mortality and esophageal cancer recurrence. The pooled hazard ratio (HR) with 95% confidence interval (CI) were derived by comparing the highest with the lowest categories of each dietary item and by using random effect models. Results A total of 15 cohort studies were included in this study and all reported pre-diagnosis dietary exposure; two focused on dietary folate, 12 on alcohol consumption and three on other dietary components (sugary beverages, phytochemicals and preserved vegetables). When comparing the highest with the lowest categories, dietary folate intake was associated with a reduced risk of esophageal cancer-specific mortality in patients with esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (HR: 0.41, 95% CI: 0.25–0.69), with low heterogeneity ( I 2 = 0%, P = 0.788). When comparing the highest with the lowest categories of alcohol consumption, alcohol consumption was associated with an increased risk of all-cause mortality in patients with esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (HR: 1.29, 95% CI: 1.07–1.55; heterogeneity: I 2 = 53%, P = 0.030), but this increased risk was not significant in patients with esophageal adenocarcinoma (HR = 1.05, 95% CI: 0.84–1.32). Conclusions This review with pre-diagnostic dietary exposure showed that dietary folate intake was associated with a reduced risk of mortality of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma, whereas alcohol consumption was associated with an increased risk. More studies are needed to investigate effect of dietary factors, especially post-diagnosis dietary consumption, on esophageal cancer prognosis.",1

We searched MEDLINE, PEDro, SciELO and the Cochrane Library (until June 2019) for randomized controlled trials. An α value ≤ 0.05 was considered significant. Heterogeneity among studies was examined with Cochran’s Q and I2 statistic, in which values greater than 40% were considered indicative of high heterogeneity and random-effects model was chosen. Analyses were performed with Review Manager 5.3. Fifteen studies met the eligibility criteria, including 664 preterm infants. The meta-analyses showed a significant reduction in pain of − 1.02 (95% CI − 1.7 to − 0.4, N = 216) during endotraqueal suctioning for participants in the facilitated tucking position group (FTPG) compared with routine care group.

Exertional heat illness (EHI) remains a persistent problem for athletes and individuals. This threat remains despite numerous athletic position statements and occupational guidance policies. This review explores primary evidence that demonstrates a direct association between 'known' risk factors and EHI. What advances does it highlight? Primary evidence to support 'known' risk factors associated with EHI is not comprehensive. Furthermore, it is not evident that single individual factors predispose individuals to greater risk. In fact, the evidence indicates that EHI can manifest in non-hostile compensable environments when a combination of risk factors is prevalent.Despite the widespread knowledge of exertional heat illness (EHI) and clear guidance for its prevention, the incidence of EHI remains high. We carried out a systematic review of available literature evaluating the scientific evidence underpinning the risk factors associated with EHI. Medline, PsycINFO, SportDiscus and Embase were searched from inception to January 2019 with no date limitation, with supplementary searches also being performed. Search terms included permutations of risk and heat illness, with only studies in English included. Study selection, data extraction and quality assessment, using the QUALSYST tool, were performed by two independent reviewers. Of 8898 articles identified by the searches, 42 were included in the systematic review as primary evidence demonstrating a link between a risk factor and EHI. The quality scores ranged from 57.50 to 100%, and studies were generally considered to be of strong quality. The majority of risks attributable to EHI were categorized as those associated with lifestyle factors. The findings from the systematic review suggest complex manifestation of EHI through multiple risk factors rather than any one factor in isolation. Further research is needed to explore the accumulation of risk factors to help in development of effective preventative measures.",0

AR affords the ability to superimpose 3-dimensional images onto the real environment. A natural extension of this technology is to help guide neurosurgical planning and a means of stereotactic planning and guidance. Here we review the literature on the use of AR in neurosurgery with a focus on current technologies and limitations. Furthermore, we discuss this technology in the context of neurosurgical training as an educational tool.PubMed search was performed for ""augmented reality and neurosurgery"" and ""mixed reality and neurosurgery"" from 2010. A total of 113 articles written in the last 5 years were retrieved, and 39 were ultimately included in the systematic review.The most common use of AR in neurosurgery was in cranial surgery (n = 26). Other uses included spine surgery (n = 9) and education (n = 2). Devices used for display of AR images varied as did image-to-patient registration methods and overall system accuracy.Although various AR systems have been successfully utilized across many neurosurgical disciplines, more research is needed to improve accuracy in registration and to assess whether AR-assisted surgery is safe and effective for widespread adoption.",0

Frequent blood transfusions in β -thalassemia patients expose them to a high risk of HCV infection. The purpose of this paper is to summarise the current data on the prevalence of HCV infection in β -thalassemia patients in Pakistan by using a systematic review and meta–analysis. Methods PubMed, EMBASE, Web of Sciences, the Cochrane Library, Directory of Open Access Journal and local databases were systematically searched for studies published between January 1st, 1995 and May 31st, 2019. Meta-analysis was performed using the DerSimonian and Laird random-effects models with inverse variance weighting. The presence of publication bias was tested by Egger test, and the methodological quality of each included article was evaluated by the STROBE. Results We identified a total of 229 potential studies, of which 27 studies were finally considered in the meta-analysis. The pooled prevalence of HCV in β -thalassemia patients in Pakistan was 36.21% (95% CI: 28.98–43.75%) based on 5789 β -thalassemia patients, but there was considerable heterogeneity. Meta-analysis estimated the HCV prevalence among the β -thalassemia patients at 45.98% (95% CI: 38.15–53.90%) in Punjab, 31.81% (95% CI: 20.27–44.59%) in Sindh, and 28.04% (95% CI: 13.58–45.26%) in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. Meta–regression analysis showed that geographical location was a key source of heterogeneity. Conclusions The pooled prevalence of HCV in β -thalassemia patients in Pakistan was more than one in three, and higher than in neighbouring countries. It varies regionally within the country. With the use of standard prevention procedures during blood transfusion, the risk of HCV transmission in β -thalassemia patients could be controlled and the prevalence of HCV in β -thalassemia patients reduced.",0

Introduction Over the last decade, due to climate change and global warming, the damage caused by natural hazards and disasters like hurricanes, floods and heavy rainfall has been steadily growing. Following natural hazards and disasters, many who lose their homes reside in evacuation shelters for prolonged periods. The loss of medical infrastructure in disaster-stricken areas can result in evacuees' health being compromised and the spread of disease and/or infection. Under such circumstances, disaster relief nurses can play a critical role in supporting these victims. This review aims to provide useful information for nurses who are working in disaster shelters. Inclusion criteria The review will include qualitative studies examining experiences of nurses caring for people living in shelters following natural hazards and disasters, published in either English or Japanese. Studies published from 2000 to the present will be considered. Methods The review will follow the meta-aggregation approach developed by JBI. Published and unpublished studies will be searched using major international databases and other relevant databases for gray literature in either English or Japanese. Two reviewers will independently appraise studies and extract qualitative data using the JBI standardized critical appraisal and extraction instruments. Findings from the review will be categorized according to their similarity in meaning and their categories subjected to a meta-synthesis to produce a single comprehensive set of synthesized findings. The final synthesized findings will be graded according to the ConQual approach.",0

We undertook a systematic review to summarise the design and evaluation of VP-based medical communication skills training systems in order to identify features of successful cases. Methods Following PRISMA guidelines, we searched four databases for studies published between 2006 and 2018. Using a refined classification scheme, we extracted data on instructional design (scenario and instructional intervention), technological design (modality and interaction), and evaluation (user experience, learning effectiveness and evaluator). We assessed the quality of studies using the Medical Education Research Study Quality Instrument (MERSQI) and the QualSyst standard assessment criteria. Results A total of 14 studies were included for review. Of these, 85.7% (n = 12) were quantitative and 71.4% (n = 10) involved undergraduate students. The most common VP training scenario was history taking followed by the delivery of bad news. Diverse instructional interventions, including tutorials, learning activities, and feedback, were embedded in the VPs. The first-person perspective animated within-screen size VP was a popular technological feature. Most evaluations concerned the reality of simulation (for user experience) and skill in expressing empathy (as a learning outcome). Of the eight comparative studies, half reported significant attitude or skill improvements in the VP group. The distinct features of VPs shown to be effective were well-designed instructional interventions (eg, a pre-activity with a protocol-informed tutorial), and post-activity (eg, debrief or reflection), scaffolding and human feedback, but not system feedback. Conclusions Evidence-based VP training can enable students to gain communication skills in a safe and affordable learning environment. Elaborate technology alone cannot guarantee effective learning, but evidence-based instructional interventions can facilitate its optimal use and bring about better learning outcomes.",0

The aim was to conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis to quantify the association between lifestyle indices and incident T2D as well as mortality in individuals with T2D. Methods PubMed and Web of Science were searched up to September 2019. We included prospective cohort studies investigating at least three lifestyle factors in association with T2D, or all-cause mortality in individuals with diabetes. We conducted pairwise and dose-response meta-analyses to calculate summary relative risks (SRR) by using random effects model. Results In total, 19 studies were included. Adhering to a healthy lifestyle (mostly favourable diet, physical activity, non-smoking, moderate alcohol intake and normal weight) was associated with a reduced SRR of 78% for T2D (SRR: 0.22; 95% CI: 0.16 to 0.32; n=14) and 57% for mortality (SRR: 0.43; 95% CI: 0.31 to 0.58; n=5) compared with low adherence to a healthy lifestyle. In dose-response analyses, the adherence to every additional healthy lifestyle factor was associated with a reduced relative risk of 32% (95% CI: 28% to 36%) for T2D and 21% (95% CI: 15% to 26%) for mortality. Conclusions Our findings underline the importance of the joint adherence to healthy lifestyle factors to prevent T2D and improve survival among individuals with diabetes. Adherence to every additional health lifestyle factor play a role in the T2D prevention and progression. PROSPERO registration number CRD42018091409.",0

A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis,"The purpose of this systematic review was to evaluate the literature available for materials exhibiting the best efficacy in preventing biofilm formation in the interior of implants. We searched PubMed/MEDLINE, Scopus, and Cochrane databases. This review is registered with the PROSPERO database and followed the suitability of the PRISMA protocol. The initial search resulted in 326 articles from the databases. After they were read, 8 articles remained, and the inclusion and exclusion criteria were applied. Six of these 8 articles were classified as in vitro and 2 were classified as in situ. The regions of the implants evaluated ranged from the interface of the pieces to the occlusal upper access of the abutment. The implant connections evaluated the Morse taper, external connection, and internal connection. Meta-analysis of the quantitative data was performed at a significance level of .05. Cotton exhibited poor control of infiltration, even in combination with other materials. Isolated gutta-percha (GP) and polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) tape with composite resin (CR) or GP performed better as physical barriers. The best results for chemical barriers were observed by the application of 1% chlorhexidine gluconate (CG) gel, thymol varnish, and the deposition of Ag films onto the surface. The applied meta-analysis did not show a significant difference in comparison between the different types of implant connections (P &amp;gt; .05). The application of CG and thymol varnish antimicrobials was effective in preventing biofilm formation and easy clinical execution; these could be used in combination with CR, GP, and PTFE.",0
https://doi.org/10.1186/s12885-020-06956-5,The prognostic value of IDO expression in solid tumors: a systematic review and meta-analysis,"Abstract Background Indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO) is a rate-limiting enzyme in the metabolism of tryptophan into kynurenine. It is considered to be an immunosuppressive molecule that plays an important role in the development of tumors. However, the association between IDO and solid tumor prognosis remains unclear. Herein, we retrieved relevant published literature and analyzed the association between IDO expression and prognosis in solid tumors. Methods Studies related to IDO expression and tumor prognosis were retrieved using PMC, EMbase and web of science database. Overall survival (OS), time to tumor progression (TTP) and other data in each study were extracted. Hazard ratio (HR) was used for analysis and calculation, while heterogeneity and publication bias between studies were also analyzed. Results A total of 31 studies were included in this meta-analysis. Overall, high expression of IDO was significantly associated with poor OS (HR 1.92, 95% CI 1.52–2.43, P &lt; 0.001) and TTP (HR 2.25 95% CI 1.58–3.22, P &lt; 0.001). However, there was significant heterogeneity between studies on OS (I 2 = 81.1%, P &lt; 0.001) and TTP (I 2 = 54.8%, P = 0.007). Subgroup analysis showed lower heterogeneity among prospective studies, studies of the same tumor type, and studies with follow-up periods longer than 45 months. Conclusions The high expression of IDO was significantly associated with the poor prognosis of solid tumors, suggesting that it can be used as a biomarker for tumor prognosis and as a potential target for tumor therapy.",0
https://doi.org/10.3390/healthcare8020080,A Systematic Review of Healthcare-Associated Infectious Organisms in Medical Radiation Science Departments,"Healthcare-associated infections (HAIs) pose a significant occupational risk to medical radiation science (MRS) professionals, who have a high degree of patient contact. Current research largely focusses on HAIs in patients, with limited attention given to infectious organisms that MRS professionals are exposed to. This is a significant gap that this systematic review seeks to address by summarizing current literature to determine the infectious organisms within MRS departments, their reservoirs, and transmission modes. Reporting of this systematic review follows the preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses guidelines. Five databases were searched (Scopus, Medical Literature Analysis and Retrieval System Online (MEDLINE), the Cochrane Library, EMBASE, and Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL)) for relevant studies published between 1983 and 2018. Quality assessment was performed using checklists from the Johanna Briggs Institute. Nineteen studies were included in the review; twelve of which were set in diagnostic radiography departments, two in radiotherapy departments, and five in non-MRS departments. No studies were set in nuclear medicine departments, indicating a gap in the available literature. A total of 19 genera of infectious organisms were identified in the literature, with Staphylococcus, Escherichia, Bacillus, and Corynebacterium reported in all MRS departments. Infectious organisms were identified in all observational studies, indicating a need for better infection control methods and/or compliance training within MRS to minimize the risk of infections.",0
https://doi.org/10.1007/s10585-020-10019-1,Breast brain metastases are associated with increased risk of leptomeningeal disease after stereotactic radiosurgery: a systematic review and meta-analysis,Brain metastases are the most common malignant tumors of the brain. Leptomeningeal dissemination is a late-stage complication of intracranial metastasis and portends an extremely poor prognosis. An increased risk of leptomeningeal disease (LMD) from metastatic breast cancer compared to other cancer types after stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) has been reported. Validation of this observation has significant public health ramifications. The aim of this study was to determine the consistency of this association in the available literature via formal meta-analysis and systematic review of the literature. Searches of seven electronic databases from inception to August 2019 were conducted following PRISMA guidelines and appropriate selection criteria. Prognostic hazard ratios (HRs) for LMD in breast cancer brain metastases derived from multivariate regression analysis were analyzed using meta-analysis of proportions. Our search strategy identified 8 studies meeting inclusion criteria which provided data on 2555 unique brain metastases patients treated with SRS. The risk of LMD in the setting of breast cancer brain metastasis was significantly greater compared to other histologic cancer types (pooled HR = 2.22; 95% CI 1.69–2.93; P < 0.001). Statistical assessment of small studies bias and heterogeneity were negative. Outcome certainty was low. Breast cancer brain metastases are associated with an increased risk of LMD compared to other cancer types after SRS. The certainty of this outcome will be improved with future prospective studies. Providers should factor this increased susceptibility for LMD in breast cancer brain metastasis to allow for appropriate risk stratification and the development of appropriate surveillance paradigms.,0
https://doi.org/10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2020.4693,Association of Ketamine With Psychiatric Symptoms and Implications for Its Therapeutic Use and for Understanding Schizophrenia,"Importance Ketamine hydrochloride is increasingly used to treat depression and other psychiatric disorders but can induce schizophrenia-like or psychotomimetic symptoms. Despite this risk, the consistency and magnitude of symptoms induced by ketamine or what factors are associated with these symptoms remain unknown. Objective To conduct a meta-analysis of the psychopathological outcomes associated with ketamine in healthy volunteers and patients with schizophrenia and the experimental factors associated with these outcomes. Data Sources MEDLINE, Embase, and PsychINFO databases were searched for within-participant, placebo-controlled studies reporting symptoms using the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS) or the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) in response to an acute ketamine challenge in healthy participants or patients with schizophrenia. Study Selection Of 8464 citations retrieved, 36 studies involving healthy participants were included. Inclusion criteria were studies (1) including healthy participants; (2) reporting symptoms occurring in response to acute administration of subanesthetic doses of ketamine (racemic ketamine, s-ketamine, r-ketamine) intravenously; (3) containing a placebo condition with a within-subject, crossover design; (4) measuring total positive or negative symptoms using BPRS or PANSS; and (5) providing data allowing the estimation of the mean difference and deviation between the ketamine and placebo condition. Data Extraction and Synthesis Two independent investigators extracted study-level data for a random-effects meta-analysis. Total, positive, and negative BPRS and PANSS scores were extracted. Subgroup analyses were conducted examining the effects of blinding status, ketamine preparation, infusion method, and time between ketamine and placebo conditions. The Meta-analysis of Observational Studies in Epidemiology (MOOSE) and Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses (PRISMA) guidelines were followed. Main Outcomes and Measures Standardized mean differences (SMDs) were used as effect sizes for individual studies. Standardized mean differences between ketamine and placebo conditions were calculated for total, positive, and negative BPRS and PANSS scores. Results The overall sample included 725 healthy volunteers (mean [SD] age, 28.3 [3.6] years; 533 [73.6%] male) exposed to the ketamine and placebo conditions. Racemic ketamine or S-ketamine was associated with a statistically significant increase in transient psychopathology in healthy participants for total (SMD = 1.50 [95% CI, 1.23-1.77];P  Conclusions and Relevance This study found that acute ketamine administration was associated with schizophrenia-like or psychotomimetic symptoms with large effect sizes, but there was a greater increase in positive than negative symptoms and when a bolus was used. These findings suggest that bolus doses should be avoided in the therapeutic use of ketamine to minimize the risk of inducing transient positive (psychotic) symptoms.",0

Bright light treatment (BLT) is a promising non-pharmacological intervention; however, studies have yielded conflicting results. This systematic review provides a comprehensive overview of the effect of BLT in dementia, with a specific focus on how study characteristics might have affected the available results. The included studies were small and comprised time-limited interventions and follow-ups. Light values, adherence to treatment, and time of year were not consistently reported. Varying designs, methods, and population characteristics such as age, gender, dementia diagnosis, circadian phase, and baseline symptoms may have moderated the outcomes and affected review results. The use of crossover designs and too high illumination as placebo lights might have nullified positive effects of BLT. Because some studies had negative outcomes after ambient BLT with high amounts of short wavelengths, more modest light levels should be further investigated. Employing rigorous designs and detailed reporting of intervention characteristics, i.e., the illumination, correlated color temperature, timing, and duration of light utilized, are of utmost importance to establish the optimal treatment approach in this population.

No systematic review of this topic has been performed. The aim of this systematic review will be to summarise the available evidence examining the association between HDP and the risk of asthma in offspring. Methods and analysis We will follow the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses and Meta-analysis of Observational Studies in Epidemiology guidelines. A systematic search of the PubMed, Embase, Cochrane and Web of Science databases will be performed using a detailed search strategy from database inception through 31 December 2019. Cohort, case-control and cross-sectional studies that report a diagnosis of maternal HDP and asthma in offspring will be included. Studies will be limited to the English language and include only human participants. Two independent reviewers will conduct the study selection, data extraction and risk of bias assessments using a standardised data extraction form. A meta-analysis will be performed to calculate overall pooled estimates using the generic inverse variance method. The data will be synthesised by either fixed-effect or random effects models according to heterogeneity tests. All analyses will be performed in Stata 14 and RevMan 5.3. High-quality evidence of the relationship between HDP and the risk of asthma in exposed offspring will be identified through the synthesis of current studies. In addition, the results of subgroup analyses and related secondary outcomes will be reported. The following will be concluded: (i) whether HDP increases the risk of asthma in offspring, (ii) whether HDP affects the severity of asthma in exposed offspring and (iii) whether possible differences in the risk of asthma among different HDP subgroups exist. Ethics and dissemination There is no requirement for ethics approval because the meta-analysis and systematic review will be based on published data. It is anticipated that the dissemination of results will take place at conferences and through publication in a peer-reviewed journal.",0

Chronic ambulatory care sensitive conditions refer to chronic diseases that can be managed in primary care settings, including angina, asthma, and diabetes, with hospitalizations for these conditions considered potentially avoidable with adequate primary care interventions. Socioeconomic inequities in the risk of hospitalization have been observed in several health systems globally. While there are multiple studies examining the association between socioeconomic status and hospitalizations for chronic ambulatory care sensitive conditions, these studies have not been systematically reviewed. The objective of this study is to systematically identify and describe socioeconomic inequalities in hospitalizations for chronic ambulatory care sensitive conditions amongst adult populations in economically developed countries reported in high-quality observational studies published in the peer-reviewed literature. Methods Peer-reviewed literature was searched in six health and social science databases: MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycInfo, CINAHL, ASSIA, and IBSS using search terms for hospitalization, socioeconomic status, and chronic ambulatory care sensitive conditions. Study titles and abstracts were first screened followed by full-text review according to the following eligibility criteria: 1) Study outcome is hospitalization for selected chronic ambulatory care sensitive conditions; 2) Primary exposure is individual- or area-level socioeconomic status; 3) Study population has a mean age ± 1 SD &lt; 75 years of age; 4) Study setting is economically developed countries; and 5) Study type is observational. Relevant data was then extracted, and studies were critically appraised using appropriate tools from The Joanna Briggs Institute. Results were narratively synthesized according to socioeconomic constructs and type of adjustment (minimally versus fully adjusted). Results Of the 15,857 unique peer-reviewed studies identified, 31 studies met the eligibility criteria and were of sufficient quality for inclusion. Socioeconomic constructs and hospitalization outcomes varied across studies. However, despite this heterogeneity, a robust and consistent association between lower levels of socioeconomic status and higher risk of hospitalizations for chronic ambulatory care sensitive conditions was observed. Conclusions This systematic review is the first to comprehensively identify and analyze literature on the relationship between SES and hospitalizations for chronic ambulatory care sensitive conditions, considering both aggregate and condition-specific outcomes that are common to several international health systems. The evidence consistently demonstrates that lower socioeconomic status is a risk factor for hospitalization across global settings. Effective health and social interventions are needed to reduce these inequities and ensure fair and adequate care across socioeconomic groups. Trial registration PROSPERO CRD42018088727 .",0

Accordingly, the purpose of this review was to quantitatively analyze reports of serial MRI of the ACL graft during the first year following ACLR; the hypothesis tested was that normalized MRI signal intensity would differ significantly by ACL graft type, graft source, and postoperative time. PubMed, Scopus, and CINAHL were searched for all studies published prior to June 2018 reporting MRI signal intensity of the ACL graft at multiple time points during the first postoperative year after ACLR. Signal intensity values at 6 and 12 months post-ACLR were normalized to initial measurements and analyzed using a least-squares regression model to study the independent variables of postoperative time, graft type, and graft source on the normalized MRI signal intensity. An effect of graft type (P = 0.001) with interactions of graft type * time (P = 0.012) and graft source * time (P = 0.001) were observed. Post hoc analyses revealed greater predicted normalized MRI signal intensity of patellar tendon autografts than both hamstring (P = 0.008) and hamstring with remnant preservation (P = 0.001) autografts at postoperative month 12. MRI signal varies with graft type, graft source, and time after ACLR. Enhanced graft maturity during the first postoperative year was associated with hamstring autografts, with and without remnant preservation. Serial MRI imaging during the first postoperative year may be clinically useful to identify biologically or mechanically deficient ACL grafts at risk for failure. IV",0
https://doi.org/10.1111/bjd.18412,Indoor tanning prevalence after the International Agency for Research on Cancer statement on carcinogenicity of artificial tanning devices: systematic review and meta‐analysis,"Background : Exposure to artificial tanning devices is carcinogenic to humans, and government regulations to restrict or ban indoor tanning appear to be increasing. Objectives : We evaluated changes in the international prevalence of indoor tanning among adolescents and adults after artificial tanning devices were classified as carcinogenic by the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) in 2009. Methods : Systematic searches in PubMed and Web of Science databases were undertaken. Overall, 43 studies reporting ‘ever’ or ‘past-year’ indoor tanning exposure after 2009 were identified. We used metaregression analysis to evaluate the prevalence of indoor tanning over time. Random effects meta-analysis was used to summarize the prevalence of indoor tanning in adolescents and adults according to sex, region and presence of age prohibitions. Results : Global prevalence of indoor tanning in adolescents for 2013–2018 was 6·5% [95% confidence interval (CI) 3·3–10·6], 70% lower than the 22·0% (95% CI 17·2–26·8) prevalence for 2007–2012. Among adults, the prevalence was 10·4% (95% CI 5·7–16·3) for 2013–2018, a decrease of 35% from 18·2% for 2007–2012. Since 2009, the overall past-year prevalence among adolescents was 6·7% (95% CI 4·4–9·6) and 12·5% (95% CI 9·5–15·6) among adults. The prevalence of tanning indoors in the past year was similar in North America (adults, 12·5%; adolescents, 7·6%) and Europe (adults, 11·1%; adolescents, 5·1%). In 2009, three countries had regulations restricting indoor tanning, compared with 26 countries today. Conclusions : Prevalence of indoor tanning has declined substantially and significantly in adolescents and adults since the 2009 IARC statement, reflecting the rise in regulations that limit this source of unnecessary exposure to carcinogenic ultraviolet radiation. What is already known about this topic?  - Indoor tanning is associated with an increased risk of melanoma.  - A meta-analysis of worldwide indoor tanning prevalence for 1986–2012 found a past-year prevalence of 18% in adolescents and 14% in adults, with higher prevalences during the period 2007–2012.  - Policies to regulate indoor tanning began to be implemented across the globe in 2009.  - Only one study carried out in the U.S.A. has evaluated the efficacy of such policies in reducing indoor tanning prevalence. What does this study add?  - For the period 2013–2018, we found indoor tanning prevalences of 6·7% in adolescents and 11·9% in adults.  - This implies a reduction in indoor tanning use of 70% in adolescents and 35% in adults during the last 10 years.  - Our study encourages policy makers to strengthen indoor tanning regulations that reduce sunbed use among the general population in order to produce maximum public health benefit.",0

Methods A literature search was performed using MEDLINE, Embase, Cochrane, CINAHL, World Health Organisation (WHO) International Clinical Trials Registry Platform and ClinicalTrials.gov databases to December 2019. Studies included participants undergoing renal transplantation only with no contra-indication to thromboprophylaxis, no history/clinical suspicion of acute organ rejection and those describing a form of chemical thromboprophylaxis intervention compared with another form, no intervention or placebo. Results Thirteen studies with 1600 patients were included. There was wide variation concerning type of thromboprophylaxis, time of onset, dosing and duration. Reports of symptomatic/asymptomatic venous thromboembolism and mortality were limited. Seven studies reported on renal allograft thrombosis. When comparing thromboprophylaxis to no intervention, there was no evidence of difference for thrombosis risk (risk ratio 0.2; [95% CI 0.01–4.63]), however all studies were underpowered to answer this question. Six studies reported on major bleeding but type of intervention, timing of onset and duration of thromboprophylaxis varied significantly, making it difficult to pool data for further analysis. Conclusion There is insufficient evidence to advise on efficacy and safety of chemical thromboprophylaxis in patients undergoing renal transplantation or to determine whether one chemical thromboprophylaxis is better than another thromboprophylaxis.",0
https://doi.org/10.1111/hsc.13011,Factors that affect health information technology adoption by seniors: A systematic review,"The number of seniors and prevalence of chronic conditions are increasing worldwide, resulting in more pressure on health systems. Health Information Technologies (HIT) present opportunities to support the healthcare needs of seniors. Although prior studies have investigated HIT and seniors, it remains unclear what factors significantly affect the adoption of different HIT by elderly people in the community. A Systematic Review (SR) was conducted between December 2017 and February 2018 (with a search update in 2018-2019) to critically appraise and synthesise existing evidence on HIT adoption factors among seniors. Following the PRISMA guidelines, five major databases were consulted (PubMed, Medline, CINAHL, Scopus and Web of Science). The inclusion criteria consisted of empirical studies, published in English, and reporting impacts of specific factors on HIT adoption among seniors in the community. A total of 41 studies were included in this review, mostly published between 2014 and 2017 in Europe and the US; the level of evidence in these studies was low to moderate. The factors that affect HIT adoption did not differ across types of technologies or age groups. The findings reveal that seniors adopt HIT that are perceived as useful and requiring low effort commitment; price/cost value were reported as adoption barriers. Social influence, facilitating conditions, senior-friendly product design, self-efficacy, Intrinsic Technology Quality, experience/training and technology anxiety may affect HIT adoption by seniors, although the evidence on these impacts remains weak and limited. Mixed and inconclusive evidence was observed on the impacts of socio-demographic variables, health condition, habit and privacy/security. Given the reported low level of HIT adoption among seniors, we call for more rigorous research in this area using a 'senior-centred' approach, which takes into account the discourse/interaction between seniors and their collective environment to better understand the factors that affect their technology adoption and address their needs.",0

Therefore, effective smoking cessation pharmacotherapies addressing tobacco co-morbidity are imperative.Areas covered: In this review, the authors performed an extensive systematic electronic literature review examining the efficacy and safety of first-line pharmacotherapies for smoking cessation, including varenicline, sustained-release bupropion, and nicotine replacement therapies (NRT) using continuous abstinence rates over 10-12-week periods in smokers with schizophrenia. Twelve trials reporting smoking cessation outcomes using interventions in schizophrenia were included and risk ratio (RR) was used.Expert opinion: Our findings support the efficacy and safety of first-line pharmacotherapies for the treatment of tobacco use disorder in smokers with schizophrenia. Further research on the long-term effectiveness and safety of these agents in community samples is warranted. Smoking cessation pharmacotherapies may warrant the consideration of the emerging use of electronic nicotine delivery systems while neuromodulation techniques also offer promise.",0

Although music is known to reduce pain in acute and chronic care settings, less is known about its effectiveness in the adult ICU.Determine the effects of music interventions on pain in the adult ICU, compared with standard care or noise reduction.This review was registered on PROSPERO (CRD42018106889). Databases were searched for randomized controlled trials of music interventions in the adult ICU, with the search terms [""music*"" and (""critical care"" or ""intensive care"")]. Pain scores (i.e., self-report rating scales or behavioral scores) were the main outcomes of this review. Data were analyzed using a DerSimonian-Laird random-effects method with standardized mean difference (SMD) of pain scores. Statistical heterogeneity was determined as I2 > 50% and explored via subgroup analyses and meta-regression.Eighteen randomized controlled trials with a total of 1173 participants (60% males; mean age 60 years) were identified. Ten of these studies were included in the meta-analysis based on risk of bias assessment (n = 706). Music was efficacious in reducing pain (SMD -0.63 [95% CI -1.02, -0.24; n = 10]; I2 = 87%). Music interventions of 20-30 minutes were associated with a larger decrease in pain scores (SMD -0.66 [95% CI -0.94, -0.37; n = 5]; I2 = 30%) compared with interventions of less than 20 minutes (SMD 0.10 [95% CI -0.10, 0.29; n = 4]; I2 = 0%). On a 0-10 scale, 20-30 minutes of music resulted in an average decrease in pain scores of 1.06 points (95% CI -1.56, -0.56).Music interventions of 20-30 minutes are efficacious to reduce pain in adult ICU patients able to self-report.",0

Of the 10,164 articles initially screened, 15 articles were included in this study.Data were extracted from the selected articles by 2 independent reviewers and put into an extraction template and into the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research (CFIR) model. The Appraisal Tool for Cross-Sectional Studies (AXIS) was conducted on each study to assess study design, risk of bias, and reporting quality of the eligible studies.Ten studies were identified as high quality, according to the AXIS. Based on the CFIR model, the top barriers identified focused on clinician training and time in the implementation process, lack of recognized value and knowledge at the individual level, lack of access and support in the inner setting, and inability of patients to complete PROMs in the intervention process. Facilitators were identified as education in the implementation process, support and availability of PROMs in the inner setting, and recognized value at the individual level.More barriers than facilitators have been identified, which is consistent with PROM underuse. Clinicians and administrators should find opportunities to overcome the barriers identified and leverage the facilitators to improve routine PROM use and maximize patient outcomes.",0

The use of biomarkers for insecticides can contribute to the diagnosis and prevention of poisoning.To identify, in the scientific literature, the biomarkers of occupational exposure to insecticides of different insecticide classes.The PubMed, Lilacs and Embase databases were analyzed using a systematic search strategy and in accordance with the criteria established by the PRISMA methodology. Articles with information related to the use of biomarkers to identify active ingredients, or insecticide metabolites, or effects on the human biological matrices were analyzed.A total of 840 studies was found, and 30 met the selection criteria. The search identified 118 results for insecticide biomarkers, of which 45% were of exposure, 42% of effect, and 14% of susceptibility. Additionally, 78 were possible biomarkers, and only 67 confirmed to be different biomarkers for insecticides. Acetylcholinesterase (AChE), butyrylcholinesterase (BuChE) and 3,5,6-trichloro-2-pyridinol (TCP-y), specific for Chlorpyrifos, were among the most common biomarkers identified; however, most metabolites found were non-specific.Various insecticide biomarkers were mentioned; nonetheless, only a few are specific and used to identify the wide range of insecticides to which farm workers are exposed.",0

This systematic review and meta-analysis was conducted to evaluate the association between sarcopenia and fracture incidence in the middle-aged and elderly people. Materials and Methods Web of Science, PubMed, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Library were searched. Weighted averages were reported as hazard risk (HR) values with 95% confidence interval (CI). Statistical heterogeneity scores were assessed with the standard Cochran's Q test and the I2 statistic. Results A total of 5 cohort studies involving 27 990 participants were included in our study. The crude and adjusted effect sizes between sarcopenia and fracture were extracted from 2 and 5 studies, respectively. Sarcopenia was significantly associated with fracture incidence without adjusting covariates (crude HR, 1.69; 95% CI, 1.34–2.13). After adjusting for potential confounders, sarcopenia still demonstrated significant positive association with fracture (adjusted HR, 1.50;95%CI, 1.08–2.08). The sensitivity analysis confirmed the stability of the results. In the subgroup analysis of studies after adjusting covariates, there were significant associations between sarcopenia and fracture in the subgroups of male, older people, American and hip fracture patients. Conclusion Our meta-analysis found that sarcopenia was significantly associated with fracture in middle aged and elderly people. However, more homogeneous studies are needed to fully clarify the relationship between sarcopenia and fracture.",0

Low socioeconomic status appears to be an independent risk factor for stroke mortality in epidemiology studies, but there has been no systematic assessment of this association. We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis evaluating the association between low socioeconomic status and stroke mortality. A systematic review of MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Web of Science for cohort studies that reported low socioeconomic status and stroke mortality was conducted from inception until July 2017. Research information, adjusted risk ratio (RR) estimates and 95% confidence intervals (Cls) were extracted. Estimates were pooled using a random-effects model. Heterogeneity was examined using the Q statistic and I 2 . Twenty-seven prospective cohort studies (471,354,852 subjects; 429,886 deaths) assessing stroke mortality with low socioeconomic status were identified. Compared with the highest socioeconomic status, overall RR of stroke mortality was 1.39 (95% CI, 1.31–1.48) for those with the lowest after adjustment for confounding factors, but there was substantial heterogeneity between studies ( I 2 = 89.9%, P = 0.001). Significant relationships were observed between risk of stroke mortality and the lowest education (RR = 1.21, 95% CI 1.11–1.33; I 2 = 70.9%, P < 0.001), income (RR = 1.54, 95% CI 1.30–1.82; I 2 = 91.6%, P < 0.001), occupation (RR = 1.54, 95% CI 1.35–1.75; I 2 = 78.3%, P < 0.001), composite socioeconomic status (RR = 1.37, 95% CI 1.25–1.51; I 2 = 69.5%, P = 0.001). After subgroup analysis, it was found that the heterogeneity of each SES indicator mainly came from the follow-up time, study population, stroke type, study area. Patients with low socioeconomic status had a higher risk of stroke mortality. The heterogeneity of income and occupation is larger, and the education and composite SES is smaller.",0
https://doi.org/10.1002/eat.23242,Labels to prevent the detrimental effects of media on body image: A systematic review and meta‐analysis,"Objective Most advertisements contain thin-ideal imagery enhanced by digital modification. The deleterious effects on body image and eating disorder risk of exposure to such images have been well documented. One of the proposed macro-level solutions to mitigate these effects has been the use of labels on images, primarily disclaimer labels. A growing number of studies have explored the usefulness of such labels in protecting body image against the detrimental effects of media exposure; however, findings have been divergent. Methods The current study aimed to conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis of the existing literature investigating the effects of including labels on media images on body image. Results The systematic review identified n = 22 studies that were included in a narrative review, n = 18 were included in the meta-analysis. Overall, findings provided little support for the use of disclaimer or warning labels as a means of protecting against the detrimental effects of media exposure on body image. Furthermore, findings suggested that such labels might increase state appearance comparison when exposed to media images. Discussion These findings are especially concerning in light of recent legislative efforts to mitigate media effects through the use of labels on imagery, as well as industry initiatives based on image labeling. Additional research examining alternative strategies for universal prevention of body image and eating concerns is warranted.",0

A systematic review and meta-analysis,"Abstract Background A number of studies have reported an association between the occurrence of immune-related adverse events (irAEs) and clinical efficacy in patients undergoing treatment with immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs), but the results remain controversial. Methods Under the guidance of a predefined protocol and Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses statement, this meta-analysis included cohort studies investigating the association of irAEs and efficacy of ICIs in patients with cancer. The primary outcome was overall survival (OS), and the secondary outcome was progression-free survival (PFS). Subgroup analyses involving the cancer type, class of ICIs, combination therapy, sample size, model, landmark analysis, and approach used to extract the data were performed. Specific analyses of the type and grade of irAEs were also performed. Results This meta-analysis included 30 studies including 4971 individuals. Patients with cancer who developed irAEs experienced both an OS benefit and a PFS benefit from ICI therapy compared to patients who did not develop irAEs (OS: hazard ratio (HR), 0.54, 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.45–0.65; p &lt; 0.001; PFS: HR, 0.52, 95% CI, 0.44–0.61, p &lt; 0.001). Subgroup analyses of the study quality characteristics and cancer types recapitulated these findings. Specific analyses of endocrine irAEs (OS: HR, 0.52, 95% CI, 0.44–0.62, p &lt; 0.001), dermatological irAEs (OS: HR, 0.45, 95% CI, 0.35–0.59, p &lt; 0.001), and low-grade irAEs (OS: HR, 0.57, 95% CI, 0.43–0.75; p &lt; 0.001) yielded similar results. The association between irAE development and a favorable benefit on survival was significant in patients with cancer who were undergoing treatment with programmed cell death-1 inhibitors (OS: HR, 0.51, 95% CI, 0.42–0.62; p &lt; 0.001), but not cytotoxic T-lymphocyte antigen-4 inhibitors (OS: HR, 0.89, 95% CI, 0.49–1.61; p = 0.706). Additionally, the association was significant in patients with cancer who were treated with ICIs as a monotherapy (OS: HR, 0.53, 95% CI, 0.43–0.65; p &lt; 0.001), but not as a combination therapy (OS: HR, 0.62, 95% CI, 0.36–1.05; p = 0.073). Conclusions The occurrence of irAEs was significantly associated with a better ICI efficacy in patients with cancer, particularly endocrine, dermatological, and low-grade irAEs. Further large-scale prospective studies are warranted to validate our findings. Systematic review registration PROSPERO CRD42019129310.",0

The logistic normal random effect model was fitted using the generalised linear mixed model with random intercepts to calculate the pooled proportion estimates.Seventeen studies with 482 patients were included in this meta-analysis. Male smokers with hyperlipidaemia and hypertension were the most prominent basic profile. IAADs were predominantly spontaneous and infrarenal, and roughly half were acute and symptomatic. Approximately 67% [95% confidence interval (CI) 42-86%] of patients were managed initially conservatively. In the overall population, the 30 day all cause mortality was 3% (95% CI 1-5%) and the long term mortality during follow up was 8% (95% CI 5-14%). Re-intervention during follow up occurred in 8% (95% CI 5-15%) of patients. In the subgroup analysis, patients with conservative treatment had a 30 day mortality of 1% (95% CI 0-8%), a long term mortality of 5% (95% CI 1-29%), and a re-intervention rate of 18% (95% CI 10-29%). Patients with open surgery had a 30 day mortality of 9% (95% CI 0-82%), a long term mortality of 12% (95% CI 4-31%), and a re-intervention rate of 9% (95% CI 1-44%). Patients with endovascular repair had a 30 day mortality of 2% (95% CI 0-10%), a long term mortality of 5% (95% CI 2-13%), a re-intervention rate of 6% (95% CI 3-13%), and a persistent endoleak rate of 4% (95% CI 2-10%).Appropriate initial treatment strategies can be used to obtain acceptable clinical outcomes in patients with IAAD. Invasive intervention is necessary if patients match certain indications for intervention. Regular imaging surveillance should be provided for all patients, especially those treated conservatively.",0

Articles published on PubMed between January 1, 1966 and March 31, 2019 were systematically retrieved without language restrictions. The included articles all presented sex-specific data of the incidence rate ratio, standardized incidence or mortality ratio, hazard ratio, relative risk, or odds ratio, or provided data to estimate the association between T1D and ESRD or kidney disease-related mortality. The gender-specific effect estimates and pooled ratio (female-to-male) for ESRD and for deaths from T1D-related renal disease were acquired via a random-effects meta-analysis with inverse variance weighting, regardless of heterogeneity evaluated based on the I2 statistic. Nineteen studies, including 122,842 individuals, were finally selected for this meta-analysis. Sex differences in effect estimates were found in ESRD (pooled ratio = 0.81 (95% confidence interval 0.69–0.94)) with considerable heterogeneity (I2 = 66.9%), but not in mortality with T1D-associated renal disease. Women with T1D have a lower risk of ESRD compared with that in men, but this finding may be biased by potential confounding factors and must be verified by other well-planned prospective studies.",0

Pooled hazard ratio (HR) values were used to assess the prognostic value of SUVmax, MTV, and TLG.A total of 10 primary studies involving 780 patients with RCC were included. The combined HRs for event-free survival were 1.32 (95% CI 1.10-1.58) for SUVmax, 2.40 (95% CI 1.20-4.79) for MTV, and 3.31 (95% CI 1.68-6.50) for TLG. Pooled HRs for overall survival were 1.264 (95% CI 1.124-1.421) for SUVmax, 3.52 (95% CI 1.451-8.536) for MTV, and 6.33 (95% CI 1.32-30.30) for TLG. Subgroup analysis revealed SUVmax as an independent risk factor for patients with recurrence or metastasis.The present meta-analysis confirmed that despite the clinical heterogeneity of RCC and adoption of various methods between studies, high SUVmax is a significant prognostic factor, especially in patients with recurrence or metastasis. MTV and TLG were associated with prediction of higher risk of adverse events or death in patients with RCC.",0

Further clarity is needed on whether BMI is associated with disease activity overall, independent of treatment response. We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis to assess the association between BMI and disease activity as reported by the Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Disease Activity Index (BASDAI) or Ankylosing Spondylitis Disease Activity Score (ASDAS) in axSpA. Methods We systematically searched for studies evaluating BMI and disease activity as the exposure and outcome of interest, respectively, in axSpA. Using random effects models, we estimated summary standardised mean differences (SMDs) and 95% CIs of BASDAI or ASDAS, comparing obese (BMI&gt;30 kg/m 2 ) or overweight/obese (BMI&gt;25 kg/m 2 ) individuals to those with normal BMI (18.5–24.9 kg/m 2 ). Results Twelve studies were included in the meta-analysis. Among all studies reporting the BASDAI at baseline, the pooled SMD of the BASDAI for those with an obese or overweight/obese BMI compared to a normal BMI was 0.38 (95% CI 0.21 to 0.55, I 2 =75.2%), indicating a significant association of higher BMI with higher BASDAI score. The pooled SMD of the ASDAS for those with an obese or overweight/obese BMI compared to a normal BMI was 0.40 (95% CI 0.27 to 0.54, I 2 =0%). Findings were robust across subgroup analyses. Conclusion These results demonstrate an association between an overweight/obese BMI and higher disease activity in studies of axSpA. Future longitudinal studies of BMI and disease activity should assess how this association changes over time.",0

We also included relevant studies from a 2014 Cochrane Review of HPS approach on health behaviours. Data were extracted from included studies and assessed for quality.Twelve eligible studies were identified from seven countries. The studies varied in outcome measures, sample size, quality and duration of intervention and follow-up. Only four of the included studies were of high to moderate quality. We found some evidence of effectiveness for physical activity only interventions and limited evidence of effectiveness for nutrition only and combined PA and nutrition interventions.There were no discernible patterns across the studies to suggest effective mechanisms for the HPS approach. The family/community component was poorly developed and superficially reported in all studies. Future research should seek to understand how best to work in partnership with secondary schools, to foster and sustain a healthy eating and physical activity culture, which aligns with their core aims. More attention should be paid to the restriction of unhealthy foods in the school environment.",0

The etiology of the disease and its related complications are yet to be clarified. It has been hypothesized that environmental factors, including pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) and the internal factors such as damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs), may be the most important inducers/stimulators of the disorder and its related complications. Previous investigations proved that pathogen recognition receptors (PRRs) are the main sensors for the PAMPs and DAMPs. Therefore, it seems that the PRRs have been considered to be the plausible molecules participating in the etiology of MS. Toll-like receptors (TLRs) have been the widely studied PRRs and their roles have been documented in human-related diseases. TLR4 is the main PRR expressed on the cell surface of several immune cells including macrophages and dendritic cells. Several investigations reported that TLR4 to be the main molecule involved in the pathogenesis of pro-inflammatory based diseases. Thus, it has been hypothesized that TLR4 may be a part of the MS puzzle. This review article discusses the role of TLR4 in the MS pathogenesis using recent in vitro and in vivo investigations.",0

No systematic reviews were found of in vivo paediatric research. Fourteen studies of diagnostic efficacy were identified. The supplementary searches found 18 guideline documents relevant to the review and 26 systematic reviews. The diagnostic efficacy evidence on CBCT was diverse and often of limited quality. There was ex vivo evidence for diagnostic accuracy being greater using CBCT than radiographs for root fractures. The multiplanar capabilities of CBCT are advantageous when localising dental structures for surgical planning. Patient movement during scanning is more common in children which could reduce diagnostic efficacy.No strong recommendations on CBCT are possible, except that it should not be used as a primary diagnostic tool for caries. Guidelines on use of CBCT in the paediatric age group should be developed cautiously, taking into account the greater radiation risk and the higher economic costs compared with radiography. CBCT should only be used when adequate conventional radiographic examination has not answered the question for which imaging was required. Clinical research in paediatric patients is required at the higher levels of diagnostic efficacy of CBCT.",0

Evidence acquisition PUBMED and Scopus databases were searched for articles published prior to December 2019 according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-analysis statement. Studies were deemed eligible if they compared overall survival (OS), cancer-specific survival (CSS), and surgical pathological outcomes in PC patients categorized as ISUP GG 4 (Gleason score [GS] 4 + 4 vs. GS 3 + 5 or GS 5 + 3). Formal meta-analyses were performed for these outcomes. Evidence synthesis Ten studies with 42,041 patients were eligible for the systematic review and eight studies with 36,250 patients for meta-analysis. The treatment type of included study was three surgery and three radiotherapy. The other four studies included many kinds of treatments such as surgery, radiotherapy, androgen deprivation therapy, and chemotherapy. GS 4 + 4 was significantly associated with better OS (pooled hazard ratio (HR): 0.52, 95% confidential interval (CI): 0.29-0.91) than GS 3 + 5 or GS 5 + 3. Positive surgical margin rates were significantly lower with GS 4 + 4 than GS 3 + 5 and GS 5 + 3 (odds ratio [OR] 0.70/95% CI 0.64-0.77 and OR 0.70/95% CI 0.56-0.87, respectively). In contrast, different Gleason patterns in ISUP GG 4 were not significantly associated with CSS (pooled HR: 0.77, 95% CI: 0.56-1.06). Conclusions GS 4 + 4 in patients with PC was associated with better OS and positive surgical margin rates. It seems likely that there is heterogeneity within ISUP GG 4. However, caution should be exercised in interpreting the conclusions drawn from this study, given the limitations of the study, which include the heterogeneity of the population of interest and the retrospective nature of the primary data evaluated.",0

The standardised mean difference (SMD) or OR with 95 % CI was selected as the effect sizes and was calculated using a random effects model. Results: Five cohort studies including 54 728 participants were identified. Offspring’s birth weight was significantly lower in high AA exposure group than in low AA exposure group (SMD –0·05, 95 % CI –0·09, –0·02, P = 0·005). There was also an association between maternal AA exposure and small for gestational age (OR 1·14, 95 % CI 1·06, 1·23, P &lt; 0·001). In addition, pooled ORs suggested that children had a high risk of developing overweight/obesity in the future in maternal high AA exposure group (OR 1·14, 95 % CI 1·08, 1·21, P &lt; 0·001 at age 3; OR 1·13, 95 % CI 1·07, 1·19, P &lt; 0·001 at age 5; OR 1·09, 95 % CI 1·02, 1·16, P = 0·020 at age 8). Conclusions: These findings have important implications for conducting health education, providing guidance on maternal diet and developing an appropriate dietary strategy for pregnant women to reduce dietary AA exposure.",1

A systematic review and meta-analysis,"Macrophage polarization is relevant for tumor biology. M2 polarized macrophages favor tumor growth and survival, while M1 macrophages support tumor destruction and antigen presentation. Markers identifying M1/M2 polarization are a subject of debate. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to investigate the association of proposed macrophage markers with prognosis across epithelial tumors and melanoma. The Medline search engine was used and 195 articles were recovered for full review. Only articles which measured markers using immunohistochemistry or immunofluorescence and had overall survival (OS) as the primary endpoint were included. One hundred and thirteen articles were finally accepted for analysis. CD68 was associated with worse survival across tumors (hazard ratio (HR) = 1.24, 95% CI = 1.11-1.37). Tumor anatomical location influenced this association. Colorectal tumors showed an inverse association between CD68 and OS in contrast to the rest of cancer types (HR = 0.56 vs. 1.34). The approach taken to measure CD68 had an impact on prognosis; when macrophages were measured at the tumor invasion front prognosis was more favorable than when they were measured intratumorally (HR = 0.94 vs. 1.4). CD163, CD204, and CD206 showed a robust association with worse OS (HR = 1.63, 1.95, 1.65, respectively). Tumors arising in the lung and the liver showed a weaker association between CD163 and OS as compared with other locations (β = -0.5401 for the lung and -0.5940 for the liver compared with other anatomical locations). The counting strategy also had an impact on CD163 association with OS, with hot-spot counting having higher HRs compared with averaging macrophage counts across spots or absolute cell counting (β = -0.4678). In conclusion, proposed M2 markers are associated with worse survival across epithelial tumors and melanoma. The anatomical origin of tumors influences this association. The compartment where the macrophages were scored and counting strategy influenced the association with OS of CD68 and CD163, respectively.",0

Systematic review and meta-analysis,"WHO grade II diffuse low-grade gliomas (DLGGs) were recently divided into sub-groups on the basis of their molecular profiles. IDH wild-type (IDH-wt) tumors seem to be associated with unfavorable prognoses due to biological similarities to glioblastomas. The authors performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of literature examining epidemiology, clinical characteristics, management, and the outcome of IDH-wt grade II DLGGs. According to PRISMA guidelines, a comprehensive review of studies published from January 2009 to October 2017 was carried out. The authors identified series that examined the prevalence rate, clinical and radiological characteristics, treatment, and outcome of IDH-wt DLGGs. Variables influencing outcomes were analyzed using a random-effects meta-analysis model. Finally, a meta-regression analysis was performed to examine the impact of therapeutic strategies on the effect-size. Twenty-two studies were included in this systematic review. The IDH-wt prevalence rate was 22.9% (95% CI 18.4–27.4%). The hazard ratio for this molecular subgroup in the DLGGs population was 3.46 (95% CI 2.24–5.36; p < 0.001), and the heterogeneity was significant (I2 = 85%, τ2 = 0.88) (HR range 1.28–376). Nonetheless, publication bias did not affect the analysis (p = 0.176). The meta-regression revealed that the extent of resection and post-operative chemotherapy affected the outcome in the IDH-wt subgroup (p < 0.001 and 0.015, respectively), with no significant association of the HR with the rate of RT or RT + CHT. The prevalence of IDH-wt tumors is approximately 23% of DLGGs. The absence of IDH mutation is associated with a heterogeneous outcome, and its therapeutic relevance for postoperative management remains unclear. Maximal surgical resection improves the overall survival in the DLGGs population, beyond molecular status. Further molecular stratification is needed to better understand IDH-wt behavior and therapeutic response.",0

PubMed, CINAHL, and Web of Science were searched systematically. Search limiters applied in these databases included humans, English language, time limits from 2009 to 2019, and peer-reviewed journal articles. Eight studies were included in the current review. While there was some evidence to tentatively suggest that greater levels of exercise were associated with certain forms of memory in Val/Val homozygotes than Met carriers, more research is needed to corroborate these findings. Regarding attention/information processing speed, executive function as well as global cognition, the evidence is either inconsistent or sparse and does not allow for tentative conclusions. Compelling evidence from high-quality clinical trials is needed to re-examine the relationship between the BDNF Val66Met polymorphism, exercise, and cognition.",0

We screened English-language publications on the outcomes of primary and metastatic spinal tumor operations. Pooled analyses and meta-analyses with random-effects modeling were performed comparing patients with and without wound complications, which were defined as surgical site infection or sterile wound dehiscence. Our search identified 5471 unique citations, from which we included 23 studies describing 5104 patients. A total of 1936 patients underwent surgery for primary tumors, with a wound complication rate of 8.1%. Subgroup analysis of benign and malignant primary tumors yielded significantly different wound complication rates of 7.8% and 26.9%, respectively. The metastatic tumor cohort included 168 patients and a complication rate of 6.6%. In a pooled analysis of primary tumors, higher wound complication rates were associated with sacral operations and the use of instrumentation. In the metastatic tumor cohort, higher complication rates were associated with female sex, smoking history, preoperative chemotherapy, preoperative radiotherapy, corticosteroid use, and previous spine surgery. Instrumentation remained a statistically significant risk factor for primary tumors with the addition of random-effects meta-analysis. Risk factors for wound complications after primary tumor operations were related to tumor histology and the spinal location of the operation. Risk factors for metastatic tumors may be related to several systemic preoperative treatments and baseline comorbidities. Random-effects meta-analysis showed the limited generalizability of these findings because of the small heterogenous primary literature.",0

To perform a systematic review of the existing literature on the effectiveness of the different primary treatment modalities for high-risk localized and locally advanced PCa. The primary oncological outcome is the development of distant metastases at ≥5 yr of follow-up. Secondary oncological outcomes are PCa-specific mortality, overall mortality, biochemical recurrence, and need for salvage treatment with ≥5 yr of follow-up. Nononcological outcomes are quality of life (QoL), functional outcomes, and treatment-related side effects reported. Medline, Medline In-Process, Embase, and the Cochrane Central Register of Randomized Controlled Trials were searched. All comparative (randomized and nonrandomized) studies published between January 2000 and May 2019 with at least 50 participants in each arm were included. Studies reporting on high-risk localized PCa (International Society of Urologic Pathologists [ISUP] grade 4–5 [Gleason score {GS} 8–10] or prostate-specific antigen [PSA] >20 ng/ml or ≥ cT2c) and/or locally advanced PCa (any PSA, cT3–4 or cN+, any ISUP grade/GS) or where subanalyses were performed on either group were included. The following primary local treatments were mandated: radical prostatectomy (RP), external beam radiotherapy (EBRT) (≥64 Gy), brachytherapy (BT), or multimodality treatment combining any of the local treatments above (±any systemic treatment). Risk of bias (RoB) and confounding factors were assessed for each study. A narrative synthesis was performed. Overall, 90 studies met the inclusion criteria. RoB and confounding factors revealed high RoB for selection, performance, and detection bias, and low RoB for correction of initial PSA and biopsy GS. When comparing RP with EBRT, retrospective series suggested an advantage for RP, although with a low level of evidence. Both RT and RP should be seen as part of a multimodal treatment plan with possible addition of (postoperative) RT and/or androgen deprivation therapy (ADT), respectively. High levels of evidence exist for EBRT treatment, with several randomized clinical trials showing superior outcome for adding long-term ADT or BT to EBRT. No clear cutoff can be proposed for RT dose, but higher RT doses by means of dose escalation schemes result in an improved biochemical control. Twenty studies reported data on QoL, with RP resulting mainly in genitourinary toxicity and sexual dysfunction, and EBRT in bowel problems. Based on the results of this systematic review, both RP as part of multimodal treatment and EBRT + long-term ADT can be recommended as primary treatment in high-risk and locally advanced PCa. For high-risk PCa, EBRT + BT can also be offered despite more grade 3 toxicity. Interestingly, for selected patients, for example, those with higher comorbidity, a shorter duration of ADT might be an option. For locally advanced PCa, EBRT + BT shows promising result but still needs further validation. In this setting, it is important that patients are aware that the offered therapy will most likely be in the context a multimodality treatment plan. In particular, if radiation is used, the combination of local with systemic treatment provides the best outcome, provided the patient is fit enough to receive both. Until the results of the SPCG15 trial are known, the optimal local treatment remains a matter of debate. Patients should at all times be fully informed about all available options, and the likelihood of a multimodal approach including the potential side effects of both local and systemic treatment. We reviewed the literature to see whether the evidence from clinical studies would tell us the best way of curing men with aggressive prostate cancer that had not spread to other parts of the body such as lymph glands or bones. Based on the results of this systematic review, there is good evidence that both surgery and radiation therapy are good treatment options, in terms of prolonging life and preserving quality of life, provided they are combined with other treatments. In the case of surgery this means including radiotherapy (RT), and in the case of RT this means either hormonal therapy or combined RT and brachytherapy. High-risk and locally advanced prostate cancer (PCa) patients are likely to undergo multimodality treatment. Patients should at all times be fully informed about all available options and the likelihood of a multimodal approach, including the potential side effects of both local and systemic treatment. For high-risk localized and locally advanced PCa, both radical prostatectomy as part as multimodal therapy and external beam radiotherapy (EBRT) + long-term androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) can be recommended as primary treatment. For high-risk localized PCa, EBRT + BT can also be offered despite a less favorable toxicity profile. In selected high-risk PCa patients, a shorter duration of ADT might be considered. Until the results of the SPCG15 trial are known, the optimal local treatment remains a matter of debate.",0

The review identified seven models for identifying people at risk in the general population; 118 diagnostic models for detecting covid-19 (75 were based on medical imaging, 10 to diagnose disease severity); and 107 prognostic models for predicting mortality risk, progression to severe disease, intensive care unit admission, ventilation, intubation, or length of hospital stay. The most frequent types of predictors included in the covid-19 prediction models are vital signs, age, comorbidities, and image features. Flu-like symptoms are frequently predictive in diagnostic models, while sex, C reactive protein, and lymphocyte counts are frequent prognostic factors. Reported C index estimates from the strongest form of validation available per model ranged from 0.71 to 0.99 in prediction models for the general population, from 0.65 to more than 0.99 in diagnostic models, and from 0.54 to 0.99 in prognostic models. All models were rated at high or unclear risk of bias, mostly because of non-representative selection of control patients, exclusion of patients who had not experienced the event of interest by the end of the study, high risk of model overfitting, and unclear reporting. Many models did not include a description of the target population (n=27, 12%) or care setting (n=75, 32%), and only 11 (5%) were externally validated by a calibration plot. The Jehi diagnostic model and the 4C mortality score were identified as promising models.Prediction models for covid-19 are quickly entering the academic literature to support medical decision making at a time when they are urgently needed. This review indicates that almost all pubished prediction models are poorly reported, and at high risk of bias such that their reported predictive performance is probably optimistic. However, we have identified two (one diagnostic and one prognostic) promising models that should soon be validated in multiple cohorts, preferably through collaborative efforts and data sharing to also allow an investigation of the stability and heterogeneity in their performance across populations and settings. Details on all reviewed models are publicly available at https://www.covprecise.org/. Methodological guidance as provided in this paper should be followed because unreliable predictions could cause more harm than benefit in guiding clinical decisions. Finally, prediction model authors should adhere to the TRIPOD (transparent reporting of a multivariable prediction model for individual prognosis or diagnosis) reporting guideline.Protocol https://osf.io/ehc47/, registration https://osf.io/wy245.This article is a living systematic review that will be updated to reflect emerging evidence.

This systematic review explores the relationship between adolescent organized sport participation and self-reported symptoms of anxiety and depression. From 9,955 records screened, 29 unique articles were selected that included 61 effect sizes and 122,056 participants. Effects were clustered into four categories based on the operationalization of sport involvement: absence or presence of involvement, frequency of involvement, volume of involvement, and duration of participation. Results from the random-effects meta-analyses indicated that symptoms of anxiety and depression were significantly lower among sport-involved adolescents than in those not involved in sport, although this effect size was small in magnitude. Meta-regression was used to identify how age and sex explained heterogeneity in effects. Although these results do not signify a causal effect, they do support theorizing that sport participation during adolescence may be a protective environment against anxiety and depressive symptoms.",0

However, disinfection guidelines for low-resource outbreak settings are inconsistent and not evidence-based. <h3>Methods</h3> A systematic review of surface disinfection efficacy studies was conducted to inform low-resource outbreak guideline development. Due to variation in experimental procedures, outcomes were synthesized in a narrative summary focusing on chlorine-based disinfection against 7 pathogens with potential to produce outbreaks in low-resource settings (<i>Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Vibrio cholerae, Salmonella</i> spp., hepatitis A virus, rotavirus, norovirus, and Ebola virus). <h3>Results</h3> Data were extracted from 89 laboratory studies and made available, including 20 studies on relevant pathogens used in combination with surrogate data to determine minimum target concentration × time (""CT"") factors. Stainless steel (68%) and chlorine-based disinfectants (56%) were most commonly tested. No consistent trend was seen in the influence of chlorine concentration and exposure time on disinfection efficacy. Disinfectant application mode; soil load; and surface type were frequently identified as influential factors in included studies. <h3>Conclusions</h3> This review highlights that surface disinfection efficacy estimates are strongly influenced by each study's experimental conditions. We therefore recommend laboratory testing to be followed by field-based testing/monitoring to ensure effectiveness is achieved in situ.",0

This review employed the developmental psychopathology framework and 4P model (Predisposing, Precipitating, Perpetuating, Protective) to organize the diverse risk/protective factors (distal variables experienced indirectly by the child) and processes (proximal variables experienced directly by the child) for child sleep problems among preschool (1–5 y) and school-age (6–10 y) children. Variables were categorized into biological, psychological, and environmental factors/processes at the individual, family/parent, and community levels. The quality of evidence was assessed using GRADE. A literature search identified 98 articles meeting inclusion criteria. Older child age, difficult temperament, previous sleep problems, externalizing psychopathology, internalizing psychopathology, and electronics use (e.g., bedtime TV viewing) were identified as child risk variables predicting sleep problems. Parental presence at bedtime (risk), negative parenting style (e.g., lax or permissive parenting; risk), consistent bedtime routines (protective), and lower composite socioeconomic status (risk) were identified as family/parent variables predicting child sleep problems. No well-established predictors were found at the community level. Future research should employ advanced research designs more frequently and investigate: 1) risk pathways across development; and 2) nightly fluctuations in sleep problems.",0

Notch signaling has an important role in the development of hematopoietic stem cells and their differentiation to committed lineages, as well as in the regulation of several non-hematopoietic cell lines. As Notch signaling has been implicated in various inflammatory and autoimmune diseases, it is of interest to elucidate what role do Notch receptors and ligands have in inflammatory arthritides. We performed a search on the role of Notch receptors (1-4) and Notch ligands Delta-like (DLL) 1, 3, 4 and Jagged (Jag) 1 and 2 in animal models of inflammatory arthritis and most common types of human inflammatory arthritis (rheumatoid arthritis, psoriatic arthritis or ankylosing spondylitis). The initial search identified 135 unique articles, of which 24 were ultimately deemed relevant and included in this systematic review. Overall, identified articles describe roles for Notch ligands and receptors in inflammatory arthritis, with Notch activation resulting in enhanced Th1/17 polarization, osteoclast differentiation, macrophage activation and fibroblast-like synoviocyte proliferation. However, the inhibitory role of Notch signaling, especially by Jag1 is also described. There is evidence that Notch pathway activation affects multiple cell lineages present within the arthritic environment, therefore potentially acting as one of the drivers of disease pathogenesis. Since cell lineage-selective transgenic mouse models and specific Notch receptor inhibitors are becoming increasingly available, it can be expected that future research will evaluate whether Notch signaling components initiate crucial pathogenic impulses and, therefore, present viable therapeutic targets in inflammatory arthritis.",0

Whether newly approved anti-diabetic drugs like sodium-glucose co-transport-2 inhibitors (SGLT-2Is) and glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1RAs) that have shown a significant reduction in the CV end-points in CV outcome trials (CVOTs) also have a differential impact gender-wise, is still not clearly known. We systematically searched the medical database up to December 31, 2019 and retrieved all the dedicated CVOTs conducted with SGLT-2Is and GLP-1RAs that explicitly reported the outcome of major adverse cardiac events (MACE). Subsequently, we pooled the hazard ratio (HR) of MACE in both sexes separately and meta-analyzed the result gender-wise. The meta-analysis of three CVOTs conducted with SGLT-2Is (N = 34,322), demonstrated a significant reduction in MACE in men but not in women (Men - HR, 0.90; 95% CI, 0.83 to 0.97; P = 0.006; Women - HR, 0.88; 95% CI, 0.77 to 1.00; P = 0.06) compared to placebo. The meta-analysis of seven CVOTs conducted with GLP-1RAs (N = 56,004) demonstrated a significant reduction in MACE in both sex (Men - HR, 0.88; 95% CI, 0.82 to 0.93; P < 0.0001; Women - HR, 0.88; 95% CI, 0.79 to 0.99; P = 0.03), against the placebo. The reduction in MACE with SGLT-2Is appears to be significantly less in women with diabetes vs men, while GLP-1RAs confers a similar reduction in MACE, irrespective of the gender. Whether these results are related to inadequate statistical power (underrepresentation of women) in CVOT, or it reflects a true gender difference, still remains to be established. • The risk of cardio-vascular (CV) burden seems to differ in women vs men with type 2 diabetes. Overall, women have less controlled HbA1c, lipids, blood pressure and received less intervention compared to men due to the psycho-socio-cultural difference, further compounded by the biological effect of sex hormones and stress related to the pregnancy. • Current guidelines have proposed an early use of SGLT-2 inhibitors (SGLT-2Is) or GLP-1 receptor agonist (GLP-1RAs) in subjects with type 2 diabetes with high CV risk, based on the results from cardio-vascular outcome trials (CVOTs). However, it is not yet clearly known whether this benefit extends equally to the women, who were underrepresented in these trials. • Our meta-analysis that included the pooled data from the CVOTs of SGLT-2Is and GLP-1RA found that MACE reduction with GLP-1RA was similar in both sexes, while benefit with SGLT-2I was only significantly apparent in men. Whether these differential findings are related to an inadequate statistical power (underrepresentation of women) in CVOT, or truly reflects a gender difference, remains to be further established.",0

A better understanding of these alcohol-induced changes in circadian rhythms will likely provide important therapeutic solutions. We conducted a systematic review based on the PubMed database examining biological rhythms in all stages of alcohol use: acute alcohol consumption, AUD, alcohol withdrawal, and abstinence. Different changes in circadian rhythms have been observed after a single acute alcohol intake, but also during AUD and alcohol withdrawal. Following a single acute alcohol intake, changes in biological rhythms are dose-dependent, reflected in the melatonin and cortisol secretions, and the core body temperature (CBT) rhythms. These alterations normalize the next morning and appear mostly for acute alcohol intake higher than 0.5 g/kg. These alterations are more severe during AUD and persist over time. In addition, interestingly, opposite patterns of the melatonin physiological ratio between diurnal and nocturnal secretion (N/D ratio",1

However, the relationship between OSA and PD is still inconsistent. Our study was aimed to evaluate the relationship between PD and OSA. Studies on OSA and PD were searched using PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, Cochrane library, and Chinese National Knowledge Infrastructure databases. Review Manager 5.3 software was used to calculate the pooled estimate effect. The inverse variance model was used to pool the mean difference (MD) or hazard ratios (HRs); the Mantel-Haenszel method was used to pool the odds ratio (OR). Heterogeneity among the studies was assessed using I2 statistic and Q test. A total of 12 studies with 93,332 cases were deemed eligible and included in our meta-analysis. Overall, the occurrence of PD was more frequent in patients with OSA (HR 1.59, 95% CI, 1.36–1.85). The subgroup analysis demonstrated the risk similarly by sex. Male and female had HR of incident PD with OSA of 1.56 (95% CI, 1.30–1.87) and 1.60 (95% CI, 1.21–2.11), respectively. The incidence of OSA did not increase in PD patients (OR 0.89, 95% CI, 0.53–1.49). The MD of apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) in PD patients was also not statistically significant (P = 0.5). The results indicate that OSA is one of independent risk factors of PD. However, OSA does not seem to be abnormally frequent in PD.",0

We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis to investigate the impact of tobacco smoking exposure, duration, intensity and cessation on response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy and long-term survival outcomes in patients undergoing radical cystectomy for bladder cancer.We systematically searched PubMed®, MEDLINE®, Embase® and Cochrane® Library databases for original articles published before April 2019. Primary end points were neoadjuvant chemotherapy response, overall and cancer specific mortality, and recurrence-free survival after radical cystectomy. Observational studies reporting Cox proportional hazards regression or logistic regression analysis were independently screened. Available multivariable hazard ratios and corresponding 95% CIs were included in the quantitative analysis. Sensitivity analyses were performed as appropriate. A risk of bias assessment was completed for nonrandomized studies.Our electronic search identified a total of 649 articles. After a detailed review we selected 17 studies that addressed the impact of smoking status on survival outcomes in 13,777 patients after radical cystectomy for bladder cancer. Pooled meta-analysis revealed that active smokers have an increased risk of overall mortality (HR 1.21, 95% CI 1.08-1.36; p=0.001, I2=0%), cancer specific mortality (HR 1.24, 95% CI 1.13-1.36; p <0.00001, I2=0%) and bladder cancer recurrence (HR 1.24, 95% CI 1.12-1.38; p <0.0001, I2=3%). Sensitivity analyses evaluating only patients who underwent neoadjuvant chemotherapy followed by radical cystectomy showed an advantage of non/never smokers in terms of neoadjuvant chemotherapy complete response rate (HR 0.47, 95% CI 0.29-0.75; p=0.001, I2=0%).Smoking status is associated with lower neoadjuvant chemotherapy response rates and higher overall and cancer specific mortality as well as bladder cancer recurrence after radical cystectomy. Appropriate preoperative counseling, together with tightened followup, may have a pivotal role in improving the smoking-related long-term survival outcomes in patients with bladder cancer.",0

Accumulating data show that there may be an association between vitamin D deficiency and schizophrenia. We conducted an updated meta-analysis to investigate the relationship between schizophrenia and blood vitamin D level. All published observational articles have been searched from five databases until September 2019. In total, 36 articles with a total of 12528 participants were included in this study. Patients with schizophrenia have significantly lower levels of vitamin D than controls. The subgroup analyses based on study design, hospitalization status, quality score, type of biomarker [25-hydroxyvitamin D or 25-hydroxyvitamin D3], and the country did not explain between-study heterogeneity; however, meta-regression on match factors indicted that match of BMI could account for some degree of heterogeneity. No significant differences in publication bias were observed. Also, subjects with schizophrenia were more likely to have vitamin D deficiency or insufficiency compared to controls. In conclusion, our analyses are consistent with the hypothesis that vitamin D deficiency is associated with schizophrenia. More well-designed randomized control trials are needed to determine whether this association is causal.",0

Animal CoVs, such as Middle East respiratory syndrome-CoV, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-CoV, and the new virus named SARS-CoV-2, rarely infect and spread among humans. On January 30, 2020, the International Health Regulations Emergency Committee of the World Health Organisation declared the outbreak of the resulting disease from this new CoV called ‘COVID-19’, as a ‘public health emergency of international concern’. This global pandemic has affected almost the whole planet and caused the death of more than 315,131 patients as of the date of this article. In this context, publishers, journals and researchers are urged to research different domains and stop the spread of this deadly virus. The increasing interest in developing artificial intelligence (AI) applications has addressed several medical problems. However, such applications remain insufficient given the high potential threat posed by this virus to global public health. This systematic review addresses automated AI applications based on data mining and machine learning (ML) algorithms for detecting and diagnosing COVID-19. We aimed to obtain an overview of this critical virus, address the limitations of utilising data mining and ML algorithms, and provide the health sector with the benefits of this technique. We used five databases, namely, IEEE Xplore, Web of Science, PubMed, ScienceDirect and Scopus and performed three sequences of search queries between 2010 and 2020. Accurate exclusion criteria and selection strategy were applied to screen the obtained 1305 articles. Only eight articles were fully evaluated and included in this review, and this number only emphasised the insufficiency of research in this important area. After analysing all included studies, the results were distributed following the year of publication and the commonly used data mining and ML algorithms. The results found in all papers were discussed to find the gaps in all reviewed papers. Characteristics, such as motivations, challenges, limitations, recommendations, case studies, and features and classes used, were analysed in detail. This study reviewed the state-of-the-art techniques for CoV prediction algorithms based on data mining and ML assessment. The reliability and acceptability of extracted information and datasets from implemented technologies in the literature were considered. Findings showed that researchers must proceed with insights they gain, focus on identifying solutions for CoV problems, and introduce new improvements. The growing emphasis on data mining and ML techniques in medical fields can provide the right environment for change and improvement.",0

Methods We searched 5 scientific literature databases for primary sources on the safety of 9 antimicrobials considered for plague during pregnancy (amikacin, gentamicin, plazomicin, streptomycin, tobramycin, chloramphenicol, doxycycline, sulfadiazine, and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole [TMP-SMX]) and abstracted data on maternal, pregnancy, and fetal/neonatal outcomes. Results Of 13 052 articles identified, 66 studies (case-control, case series, cohort, and randomized studies) and 96 case reports were included, totaling 27 751 prenatal exposures to amikacin (n = 9), gentamicin (n = 345), plazomicin (n = 0), streptomycin (n = 285), tobramycin (n = 43), chloramphenicol (n = 246), doxycycline (n = 2351), sulfadiazine (n = 870), and TMP-SMX (n = 23 602). Hearing or vestibular deficits were reported in 18/121 (15%) children and 17/109 (16%) pregnant women following prenatal streptomycin exposure. First trimester chloramphenicol exposure was associated with an elevated risk of an undescended testis (odds ratio [OR] 5.9, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.2–28.7). Doxycycline was associated with cardiovascular malformations (OR 2.4, 95% CI 1.2–4.7) in 1 study and spontaneous abortion (OR 2.8, 95% CI 1.9–4.1) in a separate study. First trimester exposure to TMP-SMX was associated with increased risk of neural tube defects (pooled OR 2.5, 95% CI 1.4–4.3), spontaneous abortion (OR 3.5, 95% CI 2.3–5.6), preterm birth (OR 1.5, 95% CI 1.1–2.1), and small for gestational age (OR 1.6, 95% CI 1.2–2.2). No other statistically significant associations were reported. Conclusions For most antimicrobials reviewed, adverse maternal/fetal/neonatal outcomes were not observed consistently. Prenatal exposure to streptomycin and TMP-SMX was associated with select birth defects in some studies. Based on limited data, chloramphenicol and doxycycline may be associated with adverse pregnancy or neonatal outcomes; however, more data are needed to confirm these associations. Antimicrobials should be used for treatment and PEP of plague during pregnancy; the choice of antimicrobials may be influenced by these data as well as information about the risks of plague during pregnancy.",0

There is need to identify risk factors for, and strategies to prevent readmission in patients with COPD. <h3>Aim</h3> To systematically review and summarise the prevalence, risk factors and outcomes associated with rehospitalisation due to COPD exacerbation. <h3>Method</h3> The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines were followed. Five databases were searched for relevant studies. <h3>Results</h3> Fifty-seven studies from 30 countries met the inclusion criteria. The prevalence of COPD-related readmission varied from 2.6 to 82.2% at 30 days, 11.8–44.8% at 31–90 days, 17.9–63.0% at 6 months, and 25.0–87.0% at 12 months post-discharge. There were differences in the reported factors associated with readmissions, which may reflect variations in the local context, such as the availability of community-based services to care for exacerbations of COPD. Hospitalisation in the previous year prior to index admission was the key predictor of COPD-related readmission. Comorbidities (in particular asthma), living in a deprived area and living in or discharge to a nursing home were also associated with readmission. Relative to those without readmissions, readmitted patients had higher in-hospital mortality rates, shorter long-term survival, poorer quality of life, longer hospital stay, increased recurrence of subsequent readmissions, and accounted for greater healthcare costs. <h3>Conclusions</h3> Hospitalisation in the previous year was the principal risk factor for COPD-related readmissions. Variation in the prevalence and the reported factors associated with COPD-related readmission indicate that risk factors cannot be generalised, and interventions should be tailored to the local healthcare environment.",0

However, the effect of POCs on long-term survival of gastric cancer patients following surgery is far from conclusive. This systemic review aimed to determine the impact of postoperative complications (POCs) on the long-term survival of patients following surgery for gastric cancer. A systematic electronic search of PubMed and Scopus was performed from inception to June 26, 2018 to identify studies that described the relationship between POCs and long-term survival. Hazard ratios (HRs) for overall survival (OS), cancer-specific survival (CSS), and recurrence-free survival (RFS) from each study were combined using a random-effects model. Sixty-four eligible studies with reported results for 46198 gastric cancer patients were included. A meta-analysis found a statistically significant difference in OS, CSS and RFS between gastric patients with unspecific POCs and no POCs, POCs ≥ Clavien-Dindo grade (CD) 2 and < CD2, major POCs and minor POCs, infectious and non-infectious complications, anastomotic and non-anastomotic complications, and cardiopulmonary and non-cardiopulmonary complications. Subgroup and sensitivity analyses did not significantly change the summary of OS risk estimates between patients with POCs and without POCs. No significant publication bias was observed for the same outcome. The meta-analysis revealed that POCs were associated with worse survival among patients with resected gastric cancer, suggesting that treatment strategies aimed at minimizing POCs may improve oncological outcomes.",0
https://doi.org/10.1111/1468-0009.12451,Can Social Policies Improve Health? A Systematic Review and Meta‐Analysis of 38 Randomized Trials,"Policy Points Social policies might not only improve economic well-being, but also health. Health policy experts have therefore advocated for investments in social policies both to improve population health and potentially reduce health system costs. Since the 1960s, a large number of social policies have been experimentally evaluated in the United States. Some of these experiments include health outcomes, providing a unique opportunity to inform evidence-based policymaking. Our comprehensive review and meta-analysis of these experiments find suggestive evidence of health benefits associated with investments in early life, income support, and health insurance interventions. However, most studies were underpowered to detect health outcomes. CONTEXT: Insurers and health care providers are investing heavily in nonmedical social interventions in an effort to improve health and potentially reduce health care costs. METHODS: We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of all known randomized social experiments in the United States that included health outcomes. We reviewed 5,880 papers, reports, and data sources, ultimately including 61 publications from 38 randomized social experiments. After synthesizing the main findings narratively, we conducted risk of bias analyses, power analyses, and random-effects meta-analyses where possible. Finally, we used multivariate regressions to determine which study characteristics were associated with statistically significant improvements in health outcomes. FINDINGS: The risk of bias was low in 17 studies, moderate in 11, and high in 33. Of the 451 parameter estimates reported, 77% were underpowered to detect health outcomes. Among adequately powered parameters, 49% demonstrated a significant health improvement, 44% had no effect on health, and 7% were associated with significant worsening of health. In meta-analyses, early life and education interventions were associated with a reduction in smoking (odds ratio [OR] = 0.92, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.86-0.99). Income maintenance and health insurance interventions were associated with significant improvements in self-rated health (OR = 1.20, 95% CI 1.06-1.36, and OR = 1.38, 95% CI 1.10-1.73, respectively), whereas some welfare-to-work interventions had a negative impact on self-rated health (OR = 0.77, 95% CI 0.66-0.90). Housing and neighborhood trials had no effect on the outcomes included in the meta-analyses. A positive effect of the trial on its primary socioeconomic outcome was associated with higher odds of reporting health improvements. We found evidence of publication bias for studies with null findings. CONCLUSIONS: Early life, income, and health insurance interventions have the potential to improve health. However, many of the included studies were underpowered to detect health effects and were at high or moderate risk of bias. Future social policy experiments should be better designed to measure the association between interventions and health outcomes.",0

PubMed, CINAHL, LiLACS, CENTRAL, and EMBASE databases were searched. <h3>Findings</h3> Of the 956 publications identified, 9 studies were selected for quantitative synthesis and 6 for the meta-analysis. The forced-air warming system was investigated in 8 studies. The generated evidence indicated that the use of an active warming method could maintain higher average body temperature as well as could decrease the surgical site infection incidence. Exposure of the patient to temperatures below 36°C in the perioperative period increased the chances of developing this type of infection. The meta-analysis indicated that the association between perioperative active warming methods compared with others to reduce the chances of developing surgical site infection remains unclear (odds ratio = e<sup>−3.59</sup> = 2.718<sup>−0.59</sup> = 0.552, 95% confidence interval (odds ratio) = (0.269-1.135), <i>P</i> = 0.106 I<sup>2</sup> = 54.34%). <h3>Conclusions</h3> The employment of an active warming method is effective to maintain higher averages of body temperature. However, more randomized clinical trials are needed to assess the efficacy of that intervention to prevent surgical site infection.",0
https://doi.org/10.1007/s11121-020-01087-6,Delivering Opportunistic Behavior Change Interventions: a Systematic Review of Systematic Reviews,"Abstract Opportunities for healthcare professionals to deliver health behavior change interventions are often missed, but understanding the barriers and enablers to this activity is limited by a focus on defined specialisms/health conditions. This systematic review of systematic reviews collates all the evidence across professional groups to provide guidance to policy makers for implementing healthcare professional delivery of behavior change interventions. Eight electronic databases were searched for systematic reviews reporting patient-facing healthcare professionals’ (e.g., general practitioners, nurses) barriers and enablers to delivering behavior change interventions (diet, physical activity, alcohol reduction, smoking cessation, and weight management). A narrative synthesis was conducted. Thirty-six systematic reviews were included. Four themes emerged as both barriers and enablers: (1) perceptions of the knowledge or skills needed to support behavior change with patients, (2) perceptions of the healthcare professional role, (3) beliefs about resources and support needed, and (4) healthcare professionals’ own health behavior. There were four cross-disciplinary barriers: (1) perceived lack of time, (2) perceived lack of prioritization of health behavior change, (3) negative attitudes towards patients and perceptions of patient risk, and (4) perceptions of patient motivation. The three enablers were as follows: (1) training, (2) context, and (3) attitudes towards delivering interventions. To enhance healthcare professionals’ delivery of behavior change interventions, policy makers should (a) address perceptions about patient need for interventions, (b) support diverse professional groups to identify opportunities to deliver interventions, and (c) encourage professionals to focus on prevention and management of health conditions.",0

Methods We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis evaluating the use of prophylactic antibiotics in patients with MM and its impact on infection risk and mortality. Results Across three included studies, a total of 664 patients received antibiotics and 650 patients received no antibiotics. The overall incidence of infection within 3 months was lower for antibiotic group compared to placebo (18.4% vs 23.4%, RR: 0.79, 95% CI 0.62-1.00, P = .05, I2 = 6.5%). There was no difference in mortality in the first 3 months (1.5% vs 3.5%, RR: 0.47, 95% CI 0.17-1.27, P = .60, I2 = 28.1%). Conclusion Antibiotic prophylaxis for a finite duration can decrease the overall incidence of infection within the first 3 months following diagnosis. This does not lead to a decrease in mortality. Further data on antibiotic resistance patterns, toxicity, healthcare expenditures, and the impact of antibiotics on subsequent therapies can assist providers in helping make decisions on prophylactic antibiotics with their patients.",0
https://doi.org/10.1016/j.envpol.2020.114263,Air pollution exposure and adverse sleep health across the life course: A systematic review,"An increasing number of epidemiological studies have examined air pollution as a possible contributor to adverse sleep health, but results are mixed. The aims of this systematic review are to investigate and summarize the associations between exposures to air pollutants and various sleep measures across the lifespan. PubMed, CINAHL, Cochrane, Scopus, Web of Science, and PsycInfo were searched through October 2019 to identify original data-based research examining direct epidemiological associations between ambient and indoor air pollution exposures and various sleep health measures, including sleep quality, sleep duration, sleep disturbances, and daytime sleepiness. Twenty-two articles from 2010 to 2019 were selected for inclusion in this review, including a wide range of study populations (from early childhood to elderly) and locations (10 Asian, 4 North American, 3 European, 5 other). Due to variation in both exposure and outcome assessments, conducting a meta-analysis was not plausible. Twenty-one studies reported a generally positive association between exposure and poor sleep quality. While most studies focused on ambient air pollutants, five assessed the specific effect of indoor exposure. In children and adolescents, increased exposure to both ambient and indoor pollutants is associated with increased respiratory sleep problems and a variety of additional adverse sleep outcomes. In adults, air pollution exposure was most notably related to sleep disordered breathing. Existing literature generally shows a negative relationship between exposures to air pollution and sleep health in populations across different age groups, countries, and measures. While many associations between air pollution and sleep outcomes have been investigated, the mixed study methods and use of subjective air pollution and sleep measures result in a wide range of specific associations. Plausible toxicological mechanisms remain inconclusive. Future studies utilizing objective sleep measures and controlling for all air pollution exposures and individual encounters may help ameliorate variability in the results reported by current published literature.",1
https://doi.org/10.1016/j.shaw.2020.03.009,Resilience Engineering Indicators and Safety Management: A Systematic Review,"A safe work environment is crucial in high-risk industries, such as construction refurbishment. Safety incidents caused by uncertainty and unexpected events in construction refurbishment systems are difficult to control using conventional safety management techniques. Resilience engineering (RE) is proposed as an alternative to traditional safety management approaches. It presents a successful safety management methodology designed to deal with uncertainty in high-risk work environments. Despite the fact that RE resides in the safety domain, there is no common set of RE indicators to measure and assess resilient in the work environment. The main aim of this research is to explore RE indicators that have been identified as important in developing and assessing the resilient work environment in high-risk industries, particularly in construction refurbishment. Indicators have been attained through a systematic literature review of research and scholarly articles published between the years 2004 and 2019. The literature review explored RE indicators in various industries. Descriptive analysis and co-occurrence-based network visualization were used for data analysis. The findings revealed 28 RE indicators in 11 different high-risk industries. The results show that the four commonly used indicators were: top-management commitment, awareness, learning, and flexibility, all of which have a strong relationship with RE. The findings of this study are useful for stakeholders when making decisions concerning the most important RE indicators in the context of their research or practice as this would avoid the ambiguity and disparity in the identification of RE indicators.",0

However, there is no published review of the evidence to guide the diagnosis or treatment of patients presenting with impostor syndrome. Purpose To evaluate the evidence on the prevalence, predictors, comorbidities, and treatment of impostor syndrome. Data Sources Medline, Embase, and PsycINFO (January 1966 to May 2018) and bibliographies of retrieved articles. Study Selection English-language reports of evaluations of the prevalence, predictors, comorbidities, or treatment of impostor syndrome. Data Extraction Two independent investigators extracted data on study variables (e.g., study methodology, treatments provided); participant variables (e.g., demographics, professional setting); diagnostic tools used, outcome variables (e.g., workplace performance, reductions in comorbid conditions); and pre-defined quality variables (e.g., human subjects approval, response rates reported). Data Synthesis In total, 62 studies of 14,161 participants met the inclusion criteria (half were published in the past 6 years). Prevalence rates of impostor syndrome varied widely from 9 to 82% largely depending on the screening tool and cutoff used to assess symptoms and were particularly high among ethnic minority groups. Impostor syndrome was common among both men and women and across a range of age groups (adolescents to late-stage professionals). Impostor syndrome is often comorbid with depression and anxiety and is associated with impaired job performance, job satisfaction, and burnout among various employee populations including clinicians. No published studies evaluated treatments for this condition. Limitations Studies were heterogeneous; publication bias may be present. Conclusions Clinicians and employers should be mindful of the prevalence of impostor syndrome among professional populations and take steps to assess for impostor feelings and common comorbidities. Future research should include evaluations of treatments to mitigate impostor symptoms and its common comorbidities.",0
https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ekir.2020.04.006,Systematic Review of Atrial Vascular Access for Dialysis Catheter,"The last decade has seen a steady increase worldwide in the prevalence of end-stage renal disease (ESRD). Hemodialysis is the major modality of renal replacement therapy (RRT) in 70% to 90% of patients, who require well-functioning vascular access for this procedure. The recommended access for hemodialysis is an arteriovenous fistula or a vascular graft. However, recourse to central venous catheters remains essential for patients whose chronic renal disease is diagnosed at the end stage or in whom an arteriovenous fistula cannot be created or maintained. Tunneled dialysis catheter (TDC) exposure can induce venous stenosis and occlusions and can result in superior vena cava syndrome and/or vascular access loss. Exhaustion of conventional vascular accesses is 1 of the greatest challenges that nephrologists and patients have to face. Several unconventional salvage-therapy routes for TDC placement in patients with exhausted upper body venous access have been reported in the literature.We report 2 new cases of intra-atrial TDC placement for patients with exhausted vascular access and perform a meta-analysis of cases from the literature.A total of 51 patients were included. The TDC was inserted by a cardiovascular surgeon in all cases. At the end of follow-up, 75% patients were alive. The median survival time was 25 months. Survival time of hemodialysis patients with intra-atrial TDC was lower than that observed with conventional TDC.This unconventional technique is safe and functional for hemodialysis patients with exhausted venous access. Atrial vascular access for TDC placement is salvage therapy and is therefore potentially lifesaving.",0
https://doi.org/10.1111/obr.13042,Access to bike lanes and childhood obesity: A systematic review and meta‐analysis,"The lack of bike lane access has been a proven risk factor for childhood obesity due to its role in discouraging healthy lifestyles. However, there has not been a systematic review of this important association in the existing literature. This study aims to fill this gap. A literature search was conducted in the Cochrane Library, PubMed, Embase, and Web of Science for studies published from 1 January 2019 onwards that examined the association between bike lane access and weight-related behaviours and outcomes among children aged <18 years. A total of 21 studies were included in this systematic review. Among them, most of the studies showed that bike lane access was significantly associated with children and adolescents' physical activity (PA), whereas only two studies showed a negative association. Meta-analysis also supported these findings and showed that bike lane access was significantly associated with children and adolescents' PA (odds ratio [OR] = 1.57, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.37-1.81). Additionally, we reviewed how bike lane characteristics and microenvironment variables such as children and adolescents' choice of bicycle travel mode, the degree of separation of cycle path, cycle path unevenness, and street maintenance were associated with adolescents' preferences and intention to cycle. This systematic review and meta-analysis strongly suggests that bike lane access is associated with children and adolescents' PA. Nonetheless, it was difficult to draw a conclusion on the association between bike lane access and weight-related outcomes.",0

The continued focus on lifestyle and health promotion on land-based industries makes it pertinent to evaluate available data from maritime settings to gain systematic knowledge on the field. Methods In this systematic review, we systematically searched PubMed and NLM Gateway (for MEDLINE), Institute of Scientific Information/Web of Science (ISI/WOS), and SCOPUS up to January 2019 using standard keywords including lifestyle interventions in the maritime setting. Two independent reviewers assessed papers and extracted the data. The quality of included studies was assessed using the Cochrane Risk of Bias tool. Due to significant heterogeneity between studies, the effectiveness of interventions was presented as a qualitative synthesis. Results After the initial search and refinement based on a total of 4432 records, ten articles met eligibility criteria and were included in the final review. Six studies originated from US maritime settings, 3 studies were conducted on Danish seafarers and one study came from Finland. The main focus of 6 studies was educational interventions including stress management, healthy eating, anti-smoking and anti-drinking sessions, sexual behavior program, and advice about preventive strategies. Four studies described the implementation of interventions, including micro-nutrient supplementation, physical activity, and pharmacotherapy. Follow-up assessments occurred over a time period ranging from 80 days to 2 years. Three studies found a positive though limited effect of structural and/or education interventions in maritime settings. The quality of all included studies was modest. Conclusion Results of this systematic review show that a limited number of studies of lifestyle interventions in the maritime setting exist and that the quality of them is generally modest. Also, most of the interventions identified have failed to demonstrate substantial health benefits for seafarers. Systematic review registration number in PROSPERO: CRD42019134533",0

The aim of this systematic review was to identify and explore the different types of digital technologies used in creating individualized, meaningful activities for people living with dementia. From 1414 articles identified from searches in four databases, 29 articles were included in the review. The inclusion criteria were the study used digital technology to deliver an individually tailored activity to participants with dementia, the process of individualization was described, and findings relating to the mental, physical, social, and/or emotional well-being of the participant were reported. Data extracted from the included studies included participant demographics, aims, methods, and outcomes. The following information on the technology was also extracted: purpose, type, training, facilitation, and the individualization process. A narrative synthesis of the results grouped the various technologies into four main purposes: reminiscence/memory support, behavior management, stimulating engagement, and conversation/communication support. A broad range of technologies were studied, with varying methods of evaluation implemented to assess their effect. Overall, the use of technology in creating individualized, meaningful activities seems to be promising in terms of improving behavior and promoting relationships with others. Furthermore, most studies in this review involved the person with dementia in the individualization process of the technology, indicating that research in this area is adopting a more co-creative and inclusive approach. However, sample sizes of the included studies were small, and there was a lack of standardized outcome measures. Future studies should aim to build a more concrete evidence base by improving the methodological quality of research in this area. Findings from the review indicate that there is also a need for more evidence concerning the feasibility of implementing these technologies into care environments.",0

However, these results are still controversial. In this meta-analysis, we aimed to investigate the prognostic role of GPS/mGPS in patients with gynecologic cancers. We explored eligible studies by searching the databases PubMed, the Cochrane Library, EMBASE, and Web of Science. The hazard ratio (HR) and odds ratios (OR) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were extracted to investigate the correlation between GPS/mGPS and overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS). Additionally, we performed subgroup analyses to detect the potential heterogeneity in our study. 11 studies involving 2830 patients were enrolled in this meta-analysis. The results revealed that a high GPS was significantly related to a shorter OS (pooled HR = 1.94; 95% CI = 1.54−2.43; P < 0.001) and PFS (pooled HR = 1.92; 95% CI = 1.56–2.35; P < 0.001) in patients with gynecologic cancers. Moreover, mGPS also predicted poor OS (pooled HR = 1.67; 95% CI = 1.41−1.96; P < 0.001) and PFS (pooled HR = 1.73; 95% CI = 1.47–2.04; P < 0.001) in gynecologic cancers patients. A higher GPS/mGPS is correlated with poor survival outcomes in patients with gynecologic cancers. Pretreatment GPS/mGPS is a valid prognostic predictor in gynecologic cancers.",0

Sorafenib, a novel biological agent, has been widely studied in the treatment of RR-DTC for years. We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis to explore the efficiency and safety of treating RR-DTC patients with sorafenib. An electronic search on PubMed/Medline and Embase was carried out to search associated articles. Fixed-effects or random-effects models were chose according to the heterogeneity. A total of 15 eligible studies (636 patients) were included. As shown by the only randomised clinical trial-DECISION, sorafenib significantly improved progression-free survival (PFS) compared with placebo in patients with progressive RR-DTC. The pooled analysis indicated that there were 26% patients (95% CI: 0.19–0.34) achieved partial response (PR), and 44% patients (98% CI: 0.39–0.48) achieved stable disease (SD). The most frequent adverse effects (AEs) observed included hand-foot syndrome (HFS), diarrhoea, fatigue, alopecia, weight loss (WS) and rash, the incidence of all grades AEs for which were 71%, 60%, 59%, 55%, 51% and 50%, respectively. There were 68% patients (252/368), who had a dose reduction because of the drug toxicities and AEs. Sorafenib could improve PFS in patients with progressive RR-DTC, comparing with placebo. Due to the resistance to conventional treatments, sorafenib is considered as a promising treatment for RR-DTC by most physicians specialised in this field. However, the use of sorafenib should be cautious due to a high incidence of AEs caused by the agent. More effective agents with less toxicities are warranted.",0
https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph17062028,Nurses’ Adherence to Patient Safety Principles: A Systematic Review,"Background: Quality-of-care improvement and prevention of practice errors is dependent on nurses’ adherence to the principles of patient safety. Aims: This paper aims to provide a systematic review of the international literature, to synthesise knowledge and explore factors that influence nurses’ adherence to patient-safety principles. Methods: Electronic databases in English, Norwegian, and Finnish languages were searched, using appropriate keywords to retrieve empirical articles published from 2010–2019. Using the theoretical domains of the Vincent’s framework for analysing risk and safety in clinical practice, we synthesized our findings according to ‘patient’, ‘healthcare provider’, ‘task’, ‘work environment’, and ‘organisation and management’. Findings: Six articles were found that focused on adherence to patient-safety principles during clinical nursing interventions. They focused on the management of peripheral venous catheters, surgical hand rubbing instructions, double-checking policies of medicines management, nursing handover between wards, cardiac monitoring and surveillance, and care-associated infection precautions. Patients’ participation, healthcare providers’ knowledge and attitudes, collaboration by nurses, appropriate equipment and electronic systems, education and regular feedback, and standardization of the care process influenced nurses’ adherence to patient-safety principles. Conclusions: The revelation of individual and systemic factors has implications for nursing care practice, as both influence adherence to patient-safety principles. More studies using qualitative and quantitative methods are required to enhance our knowledge of measures needed to improve nurse’ adherence to patient-safety principles and their effects on patient-safety outcomes.",0

Relevant studies are sparse and inconsistent. Therefore, direct comparisons are difficult to perform and impractical. Hence, we summarized and compared the efficacy and safety of IPC and anticoagulants for the prevention of venous thromboembolism (VTE) in adults undergoing cranial or spinal procedures. Several electronic databases were searched for randomized controlled trials on the use of IPC and anticoagulants for thromboembolism prevention in neurosurgical patients, from inception to August 6, 2019. Studies reporting the selected endpoints were included in direct and Bayesian network meta-analyses to estimate the relative effects of the interventions. Overall, our analysis included 18 trials comprising 2474 patients. Both IPC (RR, 0.41; 95% CrI, 0.26-0.60) and chemical prophylaxis (RR, 0.48; 95% CrI, 0.28-0.68) were found to be more efficacious than the placebo in reducing the risk of deep vein thrombosis (DVT). In addition, our analysis also demonstrated that both IPC (RR, 0.10; 95% CrI, 0.01-0.60) and chemical prophylaxis (RR, 0.31; 95% CrI, 0.05-1.00) reduced the risk of pulmonary embolism (PE) significantly more than the placebo. Based on the available evidence of moderate-to-good quality, IPC is equivalent to anticoagulants for thromboprophylaxis in terms of efficacy. Evidence to support or negate the use of pharmacological prophylaxis in terms of safety is lacking. The results of ongoing and future large randomized clinical trials are needed.",0

Numerous debriefing methods have been used in simulation in nurse education to improve clinical competencies and learning outcomes. However, there is insufficient evidence to identify the debriefing methods that are most effective in improving learning outcomes. In this systematic review and meta-analysis, the focus is on debriefing methods and learning outcomes in simulation in nurse education.This systematic review was conducted according to the preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses (PRISMA) statement.Studies published from January 1995 to December 2016 were identified from PubMed, Embase, MEDLINE, PsycINFO, Web of Science, CINAHL, the Cochrane Library, and Korean databases.Experimental studies that used debriefing methods in simulation in nurse education were included as review studies. Studies that used identical validated measurement tools were included in the meta-analysis. We applied a random-effects model with subgroups. Effect sizes for learning outcomes according to debriefing methods were calculated using standardized mean differences.A total of 18 studies were selected through systematic review and 7 studies were included in the meta-analysis using four types of scales measuring learning outcomes after debriefing. The overall effect size of the learning outcomes, according to the type of debriefing method, was 0.31. The results regarding debriefing methods were statistically non-significant in the learning outcomes (95% CI [-0.33-0.96], Z = 0.95, p = 0.34). A symmetric shape indicated a lack of publication bias.The study findings indicated that structured debriefing helped to improve learning. Future studies are needed to provide effective debriefing strategies with larger sample sizes.",0

Although it may present with no overt source of infection, its course is devastating and rapidly progressive. Surgeon awareness is needed to recognize and treat this condition appropriately. In this paper, we aim to describe a case of postoperative TSS, present a systematic review of the literature, and provide an overview of the disease for the surgeon.A systematic review of the literature between 1978 and 2018 was performed according to Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines using the keywords ""toxic shock syndrome"" and ""surgery."" Variables of interest were collected in each report.A total of 298 reports were screened, and 67 reports describing 96 individual patients met inclusion criteria. Six reports described a streptococcal cause, although the vast majority attributed TSS to Staphylococcus aureus (SA). The mortality in our review was 9.4%, although 24% of patients suffered some manner of permanent complication. TSS presented at a median of 4 days postoperatively, with most cases occurring within 10 days.Surgeons must maintain a high index of suspicion for postoperative TSS. Our review demonstrates that TSS should not be excluded despite young patient age, patient health, or relative simplicity of a procedure. Symptoms such as fever, rash, pain out of proportion to examination, and diarrhea or emesis should raise concern for TSS and prompt exploration and cultures even of benign-appearing postoperative wounds.",0

Consistent with PRISMA guidelines, we conducted the first systematic review on the pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) continuum among FSW and/or WWUD, searching PubMed, Embase, CINAHL, PsycInfo, and Sociological Abstracts. Eligibility criteria included: reporting a PrEP related result among FSW and/or WWUD aged 18 + ; peer-reviewed; and published in English between 2012 and 2018. Our search identified 1365 studies; 26 met eligibility requirements, across the following groups: FSW (n = 14), WWUD (n = 9) and FSW-WWUD (n = 3). Studies report on at least one PrEP outcome: awareness (n = 12), acceptability (n = 16), uptake (n = 4), and adherence (n = 8). Specific barriers span individual and structural levels and include challenges to daily adherence, cost, and stigma. Combining health services and long-acting PrEP formulas may facilitate better PrEP uptake and adherence. The limited number of studies indicates a need for more research.",0

The current literature on AU consists largely of retrospective series reporting intermediate follow-up and incompletely characterize the long term outcomes of AU.A systematic literature review was performed consistent with PRISMA guidelines to characterize long-term outcomes of AU with a minimum upper limit follow-up of 100 months. Penile/preputial skin flaps and graft and oral mucosal graft urethroplasties were included. The primary outcome was stricture-free survival for one-stage AU. Secondary analysis evaluated differences in outcomes based on two failure definitions: the need for intervention versus presence of recurrent stricture on cystoscopy or urethrography. Hazard rates were induced from the reported failure rates of one-stage AU and fixed and random effect models were fitted to the data. Additional subset analysis, removing potential confounders (lichen sclerosus, hypospadias and penile skin graft), was performed.Ten studies met inclusion criteria, and two studies reported separate outcomes for grafts and flaps, and thus were included separately in the analysis. The mean hazard rate across all studies was 0.0044, the corresponding survival rates at 1 year 0.948, 5 years 0.766, 10 years 0.587, and 15 years 0.45. Subset analysis of the 4 select and homogeneous studies noted 1, 5, 10, and 15 years survival rates of 0.97, 0.96, 0.74, and 0.63, respectively.The long-term success rates of augmentation urethroplasty are appear to be worse than previously appreciated and patients should be counseled accordingly.

We aimed to investigate whether lowering UA would have an effect on mortality and cardiovascular (CV) events in patients with HF in a systematic review and meta-analysis. The primary outcome measures were all-cause mortality, CV mortality, CV events, and CV hospitalization in patients with HF. We included 11 studies in our final analysis. Overall, allopurinol treatment was associated with a significant increase in the risk for all-cause mortality (hazard ratio [HR]: 1.24, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.04-1.49, P = .02). The trial heterogeneity is high (heterogeneity χ 2 = 37.3, I2 = 73%, P &lt; .001). With regard to CV mortality, allopurinol treatment was associated with a 42% increased risk of CV mortality (HR: 1.42, 95% CI: 1.11-1.81, P = .005). There was a trend toward increased CV hospitalization in the same group (HR: 1.21, 95% CI: 0.95-1.53, P = .12). Uric acid-lowering treatments increase all-cause and CV mortality but did not increase CV hospitalization significantly in this study.",0

It has several adverse health effects for both the mother and the developing fetus. This study aimed to estimate the pooled prevalence and the effect size of associated factors of alcohol consumption during pregnancy in Sub-Saharan Africa countries. Methods The results of the review were reported based on the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis statement (PRISMA) guideline and, it was registered in the Prospero database, number CRD42019127103. The available primary studies were collated from different databases: PubMed, CINAHL, Cochrane Library, PsycINFO, Google Scholar, African Journals Online and Centre for Addiction and Mental Health Library. The main search terms were [((alcohol consumption) OR (alcohol drinking) OR (alcohol use) OR (ethanol use) OR (alcohol exposure)) AND ((pregnant women) OR (pregnant mother) OR (during pregnancy)) AND (Sub-Saharan Africa)]. We used the Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) for critical appraisal of studies. The random-effects model was computed to estimate the pooled prevalence. Heterogeneity between studies was checked using the I 2 statistic and the Cochrane Q test. Results The review resulted in 963 original studies after searching various databases, and finally 37 studies in qualitative synthesis and 30 articles in the systematic review and meta-analysis were included. The overall summary estimate of the prevalence of alcohol consumption during pregnancy was found to be 20.83% (95% CI: 18.21, 23.46). The pooled estimate of meta-analysis showed that depression (OR: 1.572; 95% CI: 1.34, 1.845), partners’ alcohol use (OR: 1.32, 95% CI: 1.11, 1.57), knowledge on harmful effect of alcohol consumption (OR: 0.36, 95% CI: 0.29, 0.45) and, unplanned pregnancy (OR: 2.33, 95% CI: 1.17, 4.63) were statistically significant factors with alcohol consumption during pregnancy. Conclusions The result showed that there was high alcohol consumption during pregnancy in Sub- Saharan Africa. Alcohol consumption during pregnancy was associated with depression, partners’ alcohol use, unplanned pregnancy and knowledge of the harmful effects of alcohol consumption. Therefore, this will be a basis for public policy and resource allocation for prevention initiatives.",0
https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neucir.2020.02.003,Prophylactic anticonvulsant therapy in high-grade glioma: A systematic review and meta-analysis of longitudinal studies,"Abstract Introduction It is common practice to prescribe prophylactic antiepileptic drugs (AED) to high-grade glioma (HGG) patients without a history of seizures, yet with limited evidence supporting its use. Ideally, the effectiveness of prophylactic anticonvulsants must outweigh the occurrence of adverse effects and interactions related to AED. The authors conducted a systematic review and metanalysis of longitudinal studies regarding the effectiveness of prophylactic AED in seizure-naive HGG patients. Materials and methods PubMed/MEDLINE, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled trials, Embase and clinicaltrials.gov databases were systematically searched. Of the initial 1773 studies identified, 15 were finally selected for data extraction and analysis. Heterogeneity among studies, pooled hazard ratios, publication bias and sensitivity analyses were performed separately for a 15-study group (HGG patients within larger series of brain tumors) and a 6-study group (exclusively HGG patients). Results AED prophylaxis did not significantly reduce the incidence of postoperative seizures compared with controls, both in the 15-study group (Mantel-Haenszel random-effects pooled OR 1.08, 95% CI 0.82–1.43, 2123 patients) and in the 6-study group (pooled OR 1.22, 95% CI 0.77–1.92, 540 patients). However, some issues (paucity of prospective trials, overall moderate-risk of bias, and few studies addressing HGG patients exclusively) preclude firm conclusions against routine prophylactic AED prescription. Reported adverse effects attributable to AED were acceptable in the majority of studies. Conclusions Within the limitations of this review, the results of this metanalysis do not support the routine administration of prophylactic AED to HGG patients without a history of seizures.",0

Particularly, animal-assisted therapies and animal-assisted activities are often implemented in hospitals, rehabilitation centers, and other health facilities. These interventions bring several benefits to patients but can also expose them to the risk of infection with potentially zoonotic agents. The dog is the main animal species involved used in these interventions. Therefore, we aimed at collecting data regarding the occurrence of the pathogens ESKAPE (Enterococcus faecium, Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Acinetobacter baumannii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Enterobacter spp.) in dogs, in order to draft guidelines concerning the possible monitoring of dogs involved in animal-assisted therapies and animal-assisted activities in healthcare facilities. We performed a literature search using the PRISMA guidelines to examine three databases: PubMed, Web of Science, and Scopus. Out of 2604 records found, 52 papers were identified as eligible for inclusion in the review/meta-analysis. Sixteen papers reported data on E. faecium; 16 on S. aureus; nine on K. pneumoniae; four on A. baumannii; eight on P. aeruginosa; and six on Enterobacter spp. This work will contribute to increased awareness to the potential zoonotic risks posed by the involvement of dogs in animal-assisted therapies, and animal-assisted activities in healthcare facilities.",0

In this systematic review and meta-analysis, we summarize the current literature on the postoperative analgesic effect of QL block. Design We systematically searched PubMed, CENTRAL, CINAHL, EMBASE, Clinical Trials Registry (U.S. National Library of Medicine), Web of Science and Google Scholar for randomized control trials. The primary outcome was the comparison of 24-hour opioid requirements between the QL block and systemic analgesia cohorts; secondary outcomes included time to rescue analgesia, postoperative nausea and vomiting, block related complications and comparison between QLB and other regional anesthesia techniques. Main results We identified 22 studies for inclusion: 16 studies compared QL block to GA with systemic analgesia, four studies compared the QL block with the TAP block, and the rest on other comparisons (such as femoral block and continuous wound infiltration). QL block significantly reduced the opioid requirement in cesarean deliveries and renal surgeries, there were insufficient studies for the other surgery types. Several studies reported that QLB was associated with significantly reduced pain for up to 24 h postoperatively, but quantitative analysis is not possible due to high heterogeneity. The most common block related complication was local anesthetic toxicity. Conclusions QL block significantly reduces opioid requirement in cesarean delivery and in renal surgery. The evidence for other surgery types are limited. QL block may have analgesic effect for up to 24 h postoperatively, but the evidence is again limited. There is currently limited evidence comparing QL block to other analgesic techniques, further studies are needed in this area.",0

It has been associated with multiple long-term deleterious outcomes including revictimization in adulthood. This systematic review of 25 studies synthesizes research examining possible risk and protective factors that might explain the established link between CSA and future victimizations. Specific risk factors identified included co-occurring maltreatment in the home, risky sexual behavior (particularly in adolescence), post-traumatic stress disorder, emotion dysregulation, and other maladaptive coping strategies. Only one protective factor was identified: perceived parental care. The review also revealed considerable variability in definitions and measurement of both CSA and adult victimization, particularly in terms of how researchers conceptualized age. Many of the studies were limited in generalizability by including only college-age women. These findings have clinical and research implications. Public health interventions working to prevent revictimization among CSA survivors can utilize these findings when designing programs. For researchers, the results highlight the need for standardized definitions of both CSA and revictimization, for well-validated and consistent measurement, and for inclusion of additional population groups in future research.",0

Evidence for the comparisons from head-to-head comparative trials is currently insufficient. This meta-analysis assessed the comparative efficacy and safety of these two groups of agents for HR+/HER2- metastatic breast cancer. Methods Systematic searches of PubMed, Embase, CENTRAL, SciSearch between January 2010 to December 2019 were conducted. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) which evaluated clinical benefits and toxicities of CDK4/6 inhibitors or PI3K/AKT/mTOR inhibitors plus endocrine therapy were adopted. Primary endpoints were progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS). Secondary endpoint was treatment-related adverse event (TRAE). Pooled hazard ratio (HR) and risk rate (RR) were used to assess the differences between CDK4/6 and PI3K/AKT/mTOR inhibitors. Results A total of twenty RCTs including 9771 participants were identified in this study. Pooled results showed that PFS was considerably prolonged by targeted therapy plus endocrine therapy. PFS was relatively better in CDK4/6 inhibitors than that of PI3K inhibitor group (HR, 1.43; 95%CrI, 1.12-1.61). Similar results were demonstrated in results after balancing lines of therapy or metastatic sites, both in viscera and bone-only. Coalesced outcomes revealed that CDK4/6 inhibitors plus endocrine therapy could significantly improve OS (HR, 0.78; 95%CrI, 0.65-0.94) than PI3K/mTOR inhibitors. Safety profiles of diarrhea and rash were consistent between CDK4/6 inhibitors and PI3K/AKT/mTOR inhibitors with no difference of estimated RR. Several TRAEs signified specificity, for instance, myelosuppression in CDK4/6 inhibitors or hyperglycemia in PI3K/mTOR inhibitors. Conclusions Clinical efficacy is in favor of CDK4/6 inhibitors, and safety profiles are comparable between CDK4/6 inhibitors or PI3K/AKT/mTOR inhibitors plus endocrine therapy.",0

A regimen of cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone, with (R-CHOP) or without (CHOP) rituximab is the standard first-line treatment for aggressive non-Hodgkin lymphoma, and doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide are both associated with left ventricular dysfunction. The aim of this systematic review and meta-analysis was to evaluate the cardiovascular toxicity of this regimen.We systematically searched PubMed, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Library from database inception to June 3, 2019, for clinical trials and observational studies in adult patients with non-Hodgkin lymphoma (diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, follicular lymphoma, mantle cell lymphoma, peripheral T-cell lymphoma, and non-Hodgkin lymphoma not otherwise specified) that received first-line treatment with R-CHOP or CHOP. Studies reporting on cardiovascular adverse events and treatment-related cardiovascular mortality were included. Abstracts and articles not written in English were excluded. The main outcomes were the proportion of patients with grade 3-4 cardiovascular adverse events and heart failure. Meta-analyses of one-sample proportions were done in all patients receiving CHOP or R-CHOP. Subgroup analyses on summary estimates were done to determine the effect of number of CHOP or R-CHOP cycles, cycle interval, age, and sex.Of 2314 identified entries, 137 studies (21 211 patients) published between April, 1984, and June, 2019 were eligible (9541 patients treated with CHOP, 11 293 patients treated with R-CHOP, 377 both regimens used in the study; median follow-up 39·0 months [IQR 25·5-52·8]). From the included studies, 85 subgroups were treated with CHOP, 76 with R-CHOP, and in four studies both CHOP and R-CHOP were used without a subdivision in separate groups. The pooled proportion for grade 3-4 cardiovascular adverse events, based on 77 studies (n=14 351 patients), was 2·35% (95% CI 1·81-2·93; heterogeneity test Q=326·21; τ2=0·0042; I2=71·40%; p<0·0001). For heart failure, the pooled proportion, based on 38 studies (n=5936 patients), was 4·62% (2·25-7·65; heterogeneity test Q=527·33; τ2=0·0384; I2=95·05%; p<0·0001), with a significant increase in reported heart failure from 1·64% (95% CI 0·82-2·65) to 11·72% (3·00-24·53) when cardiac function was evaluated post-chemotherapy (p=0·017). 53 (39%) of 137 studies were rated as having high risk of bias for incomplete outcome data and 54 (39%) for selective reporting.The considerable increase of reported heart failures with cardiac monitoring, indicates that this complication often remains undiagnosed in patients with non-Hodgkin lymphoma who received first-line R-CHOP or CHOP. Our findings are of importance to raise awareness of this complication among clinicians treating patients with non-Hodgkin lymphoma and stresses the need for cardiac monitoring during and after chemotherapy. Prompt initiation of treatment for heart failure in the presymptomatic phase can mitigate the progression to more advanced heart failure stages.None.",0
https://doi.org/10.1016/j.radi.2019.09.009,A systematic review of incubator-based neonatal radiography – What does the evidence say?,"Abstract Objectives This systematic review aimed to explore the impact of incubator design (canopy, mattress, and mattress support) on neonatal imaging in terms of imaging technique, radiation dose and image quality. Key Findings A systematic literature review was performed by searching multiple healthcare databases. Following study selection and extraction, 7 articles were deemed eligible and included within the study. Of these 7 studies, six were experimental phantom based with the remaining one being a retrospective analysis. Four studies reported a percentage reduction in beam attenuation for incubator components ranging from 12% to 72% with one other study reporting a reduction but with no numerical data. This wide variation in radiation beam attenuation from the incubator components was correlated with image quality within five studies, two suggesting reduced image quality when using the incubator tray under the mattress support whilst the other three found no significant difference. Although the seven studies reported that incubator components reduced X-ray beam intensity, there was limited evidence on whether this required an increase in exposure factors. Only one study suggested increasing exposure parameters to accommodate for the increase in beam attenuation when using an incubator tray. Conclusion The literature clearly demonstrates that with existing incubator designs, there is considerable beam attenuation between placing the image receptor directly behind the neonate as oppose to the incubator tray. However, this radiation beam attenuation is not well correlated to neonatal radiation dose or image quality effects and therefore is very confusing when considering clinical implementation. Implications for practice This review highlights the need for standardisation and further optimisation work to ensure best practice for this vulnerable patient group.",0

However, a dearth of population-level representative data from SSA is a barrier to assessing PTSD. This manuscript sought to calculate pooled PTSD prevalence estimates from nationally and regionally representative surveys in SSA.The search was conducted in PubMed, Embase, PsycINFO, and PTSDpubs and was last run between October 18, 2019, and November 11, 2019. We included studies that were published in peer-reviewed journals; used probabilistic sampling methods and systematic PTSD assessments; and included ≥ 450 participants who were current residents of an SSA country, at least 50% of whom were aged between 15 and 65 years. The primary outcomes were point prevalence estimates of PTSD across all studies, and then within subgroups. The protocol was registered with the International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews (PROSPERO) (registration number CRD42016029441). Out of 2,825 unique articles reviewed, 25 studies including a total of 58,887 eligible participants (54% female) in 10 out of the 48 countries in SSA were identified. Most studies enrolled any adult aged 18 years or older. However, some studies only enrolled specific age brackets or persons as young as 15 years old. Six studies were national surveys, and 19 were regional. There were 4 key findings in the meta-analysis: (1) the overall pooled prevalence of probable PTSD was 22% (95% CI 13%-32%), while the current prevalence-defined as 1 week to 1 month-was 25% (95% CI 16%-36%); (2) prevalence estimates were highly variable, ranging from 0% (95% CI 0%-0%) to 74% (95% CI 72%-76%); (3) conflict-unexposed regions had a pooled prevalence of probable PTSD of 8% (95% CI 3%-15%), while conflict-exposed regions had a pooled prevalence of probable PTSD of 30% (95% CI 21%-40%; p < 0.001); and (4) there was no significant difference in the pooled prevalence of PTSD for men and women. The primary limitations of our methodology are our exclusion of the following study types: those published in languages other than English, French, and Portuguese; smaller studies; those that focused on key populations; those that reported only on continuous measures of PTSD symptoms; and unpublished or non-peer-reviewed studies.In this study, PTSD symptoms consistent with a probable diagnosis were found to be common in SSA, especially in regions exposed to armed conflict. However, these studies only represent data from 10 of the 48 SSA countries, and only 6 studies provided national-level data. Given the enormous heterogeneity expected across the continent, and also within countries and regions, this review cannot speak to rates of PTSD in any regions not included in this review. Thus, substantial gaps in our knowledge of PTSD prevalence in SSA remain. More research on population-level prevalence is needed to determine the burden of trauma symptoms and PTSD in SSA and to identify acceptable and feasible approaches to address this burden given limited mental healthcare resources.",0

This diversifies learning experiences for students using SBE and may decrease costs.This study aimed to determine the impact of students portraying the roles of patients in a simulation-based learning environment (peer simulation) on learning outcomes in entry-level health care professional students.Seven databases were searched (from inception to 8 May 2019) using terms including 'peer simulation,' 'role-play' and 'simulated/standardised patient.' The studies included described a health care professional student SBE interaction involving peer simulation. Data were extracted by two independent investigators. Study quality was assessed using the Medical Education Research Study Quality Instrument (MERSQI) and Critical Appraisal Skills Programme (CASP). A descriptive analysis was completed and meta-analysis conducted in instances in which outcomes could be pooled.A total of 12 studies met the inclusion criteria. Constructs measured by the studies included communication, empathy, self-efficacy and confidence. Five randomised controlled trials compared peer simulation with the use of SPs and demonstrated greater or equivalent patient empathy gains in peer simulation. Meta-analysis determined no difference in communication capabilities between the two groups. Students perceived peer simulation as comparably valuable and frequently superior to other forms of learning. This review was unable to determine effective design features of peer simulation initiatives.Students were positive about peer simulation, but there has been limited evaluation of learning outcome attainment. Significant heterogeneity was observed; studies were diverse in design, outcome measures and the training provided for peer patients. Peer simulation positively influences student communication and development of patient empathy and offers an alternative to learning with SPs. Further rigorous research is required to understand the impact of peer simulation for a broader range of learning outcomes and to confirm the impact of this developing educational approach.",0

Searches were performed on 13 databases. Only randomized controlled trials enrolling patients ≥ 18 years of age were included. Risk of bias was assessed with the Cochrane Collaboration's tool and interrater agreement between authors for full-texts selection was evaluated with Cohen's Kappa. No meta-analysis was performed and qualitative analysis was conducted.24 randomized controlled trials which intervention included communicative and educative strategies were selected. Most of the studies were judged as low risk of bias and Cohen's Kappa was excellent ( = 0.822). Interventions addressed were cognitive behavioral therapy as unique treatment or combined with other treatments (multimodal interventions), coaching, mindfulness, pain science education, self-management, graded activity and graded exposure.Patient's low back pain awareness/knowledge is still a grey area of literature. Pain science education, graded exposure and multimodal interventions are the most effective for behavior modification and compliance with exercise with benefits also in the long-term, while self-management, graded activity and coaching provide only short-term or no benefits.",0

Vertebral augmentation (VA), defined as either vertebroplasty and/or balloon kyphoplasty (BKP), is a minimally invasive surgical treatment to reduce pain and further collapse and/or renew vertebral body height by introducing bone cement into fractured vertebrae. Nonsurgical management (NSM) for OVCF carries inherent risks. Purpose To summarize the literature and perform a meta-analysis on the mortality outcomes of patients with OVCF treated with VA compared with those in patients treated with NSM. Materials and Methods A single researcher performed a systematic literature review using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses, or PRISMA, guidelines. Online scientific databases were searched in April 2018 for English-language publications. Included studies investigated mortality in patients with OVCF with VA as the primary intervention and NSM as the comparator. A meta-analysis was performed for studies that reported hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). HR was used as a summary statistic and was random-effect-models tested. The χ2 test was used to study heterogeneity between trials, and the I2 statistic was calculated to estimate variation across studies. Results Of the 16 included studies, eight reported mortality benefits in VA, seven reported no mortality difference, and one reported mixed results. Seven studies were included in a meta-analysis examining findings in more than 2 million patients with OVCF (VA = 382 070, NSM = 1 707 874). The pooled HR comparing VA to NSM was 0.78 (95% CI: 0.66, 0.92; P = .003), with mortality benefits across 2- and 5-year periods (HR = 0.70, 95% CI: 0.69, 0.71, P < .001; and HR = 0.79, 95% CI: 0.62, 0.9999, P = .05; respectively). Balloon kyphoplasty provided mortality benefits over vertebroplasty, with HRs of 0.77 (95% CI: 0.77, 0.78; P < .001) and 0.87 (95% CI: 0.87, 0.88; P < .001), respectively. Conclusion In a meta-analysis of more than 2 million patients, those with osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures who underwent vertebral augmentation were 22% less likely to die at up to 10 years after treatment than those who received nonsurgical treatment. © RSNA, 2020 See also the editorial by Jennings in this issue.",0

This study evaluates the effect of short time and long-term exposure to AAP on respiratory morbidity, mortality and premature mortality for the exposed population. A total of 59 studies are reviewed to examine the effects of short-term exposure (n = 23); long-term exposure (n = 18) and premature mortality (n = 18). Short-term exposures to ambient pollutants have strong associations between COPD, respiratory illnesses and higher rates of hospital admission or visit. The long-term effects of AAP, associated with deficit lung function, asthma, heart attack, cardiovascular mortality and premature mortality have received much attention. Particulate matter (PM2.5 and PM10) is primarily responsible for respiratory health problems. Out of 18 literature reviewed on premature mortality, most (12 of 18) studies have statistically significant associations between AAP exposure and increased premature mortality risk.",1

The aim of this study was to define the prevalence of late gastrointestinal toxicities. Electronic databases of Cochrane Library, Embase, Web of Science, CENTRAL and PubMed were searched until September 2019. We used the following keywords: radiotherapy, radiation therapy, irradiation, rectal cancer, gastrointestinal toxicity, adverse effects, late effects, pelvic radiation and pelvic radiation disease. Nine studies were included into this review out of 4785 that were preidentified as potentially relevant. Overall prevalence of severe (Grade 3 or higher) late irradiation-induced gastrointestinal toxicities was up to 19%. Most frequent toxicities of any grade were reported to be diarrhoea (up to 35%), faecal incontinence (22%), incontinence to gas (71%), rectal bleeding (9%), rectal pain (13%) and obstruction (7.4%). Preoperative treatment approaches and more advance radiotherapy techniques such as intensity-modulated and image-guided radiotherapy (IMRT) and volumetric modulated arc therapy (VMAT) turn out to result in lower late gastrointestinal toxicity rates. After great improvements in rectal cancer treatment, late gastrointestinal toxicity after radiotherapy is experienced less frequent and less severe; however, it remains a great concern associated with worse quality of life.",0
https://doi.org/10.1093/ntr/ntz038,Tobacco Cost of Illness Studies: A Systematic Review,"Abstract Introduction To identify studies reporting costs arising from tobacco use and detail their (1) economic approaches, (2) health outcomes, and (3) other cost areas included. Methods We searched PubMed, Scopus, Cochrane Library, EconLit, and Google Scholar for studies published between 2008 and April 2018 in English. Eligible articles reported tobacco-related costs and included all tobacco-using populations (multinational, national, subpopulations, and involuntary smokers). All economic approaches that resulted in monetary outcomes were included. We reported USD or converted local currencies to USD. Two health economists extracted and two researchers independently reviewed the data. Results From 4083 articles, we reviewed 361 abstracts and examined 79 full-texts, with 63 (1.6%) deemed eligible. There were three multinational, thirty-four national, twenty-one subpopulation or condition(s)-specific analyses, and five evaluating involuntary smoking. The diverse approaches and outcomes precluded integrating costs, but these were substantial in all studies. For instance, about USD 1436 billion in global health expenditures and productivity losses in 2012 and USD 9 billion in lost productivity in China, Brazil, and South Africa in 2012. At the national level, costs ranged from USD 4665 in annual per respondent health expenses (Germany 2006–2008) to USD 289–332.5 billion in medical expenses (United States 1964–2014). Conclusions Despite wide variations in the methods used, the identified costs of tobacco are substantial. Studies on tobacco cost-of-illness use diverse methods and hence produce data that are not readily comparable across populations, time, and studies, precluding a consistent evidence-base for action and measurement of progress. Recommendations are made to improve comparability. Implications In addition to the health and financial costs to individual smokers, smoking imposes costs on the broader community. Production of comparable estimates of the societal cost of tobacco use is impaired by a plethora of economic models and inconsistently included costs and conditions. These inconsistencies also cause difficulties in comparing relative impacts caused by differing factors. The review systematically documents the post-2007 literature on tobacco cost-of-illness estimations and details conditions and costs included. We hope this will encourage replication of models across settings to provide more consistent data, able to be integrated across populations, over time, and across risk factors.",0

These products may be prescribed by the dentist or purchased over the counter and comprise different modes to whiten the teeth and are administered in a range of ways by the person. This review found that the evidence was insufficient to draw reliable conclusions about the intervention, i.e., the use of these whitening products. The results indicated that people may experience side effects that irritate the mouth and gums. Therefore, nurses should direct people who are interested in teeth whitening to their dental professional for a discussion.",0

Information and communication technologies (ICT) are subject to constant and rapid development, and can contribute to the goal of an improved QoL for older adults. In order to utilise future ICT solutions as a part of an age-friendly smart environment that helps achieve personalised ageing with an increased QoL, one must first determine whether the existing ICT solutions are satisfying the needs of older people. In order to accomplish that, this study contributes in three ways. First, it proposes a framework for the QoL of older adults, in order to provide a systematic review of the state-of-the-art literature and patents in this field. The second contribution is the finding that selected ICT solutions covered by articles and patents are intended for older adults and are validated by them. The third contribution of the study are the six recommendations that are derived from the review of the literature and the patents which would help move the agenda concerning the QoL of older people and personalised ageing with the use of ICT solutions forward.",0

Of 681 studies found by searching in databases, including Scopus, Web of Science, Embase, and PubMed on November 29, 2019, the number of 13 studies, including seven cohort, five case-control, and one cross-sectional studies with 1,626,910 participants and 45,713 cases of MI was included. The pooled relative risk (RR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) of MI were calculated using a random-effect model across studies. Heterogeneity measures by reporting the I-square index. Subgroup analysis according to the designs and sensitivity analysis based on the Jackknife approach was performed. We observed in the eight studies the association was investigated in different noise exposure groups and in the 10 studies (including two conference papers) the risk of MI was provided per specific unit increment of RTN. We ran two independent types of meta-analyses involving a categorical analysis (comparing the highest and the lowest category of noise exposure groups) and an exposure-response analysis (the risk of MI per 10-dB increment of RTN). The pooled RR (95% CI) of MI for the categorical and exposure-response meta-analyses was calculated 1.03 (0.93, 1.13) and 1.02 (1.00, 1.05), respectively. For both types of meta-analyses, subgroup analysis indicates a significant association in the studies with case-control and cross-sectional designs but not cohort studies. For the exposure-response meta-analysis, a significantly greater risk of MI was observed after excluding the two conference papers (RR = 1.03 and 95% CI = 1.00, 1.05) and by further excluding the studies provided originally the risk of MI only for the categorical analysis (RR = 1.02 and 95% CI = 1.01, 1.03). We did not show a significant publication bias across studies. In conclusion, our study suggests a significant odds of association between exposure to RTN and the risk of MI.",1

There is a need to understand what interventions are effective to improve outcomes for people who have experienced ACEs. Methods Systematic review of systematic reviews. We searched 18 database sources from 2007 to 2018 for systematic reviews of effectiveness data on people who experienced ACEs aged 3–18, on any intervention and any outcome except incidence of ACEs. We included reviews with a summary quality score (AMSTAR) of 5.5 or above. Results Twenty-five reviews were included. Most reviews focus on psychological interventions and mental health outcomes. The strongest evidence is for cognitive-behavioural therapy for people exposed to abuse. For other interventions – including psychological therapies, parent training, and broader support interventions – the findings overall are inconclusive, although there are some positive results. Conclusions There are significant gaps in the evidence on interventions for ACEs. Most approaches focus on mitigating individual psychological harms, and do not address the social pathways which may mediate the negative impacts of ACEs. Many negative impacts of ACEs (e.g. on health behaviours, social relationships and life circumstances) have also not been widely addressed by intervention studies.",0

The reviewers then extracted data and assessed quality.Eighteen studies met inclusion criteria. Among patients with a testicular germ cell tumor the prevalence of contralateral germ cell neoplasia in situ was 4.0% to 8.1%. No significant difference in the risk of metachronous malignancy was identified between unscreened groups vs those with routine contralateral testicular screening (cumulative incidence 1.9% vs 3.1%, p=0.097, respectively). Patients who presented with a history of testicular atrophy, age less than 40 years or cryptorchidism had an elevated risk of germ cell neoplasia in situ. In patients with germ cell neoplasia in situ the use of 18 to 20 Gy radiation therapy demonstrated the lowest rate of disease on followup biopsies (0% to 2.5%), compared to a median of 30% on biopsies in patients treated with cisplatin based chemotherapy. Carboplatin based treatment regimens demonstrated positive disease in 66% to 75% on repeat biopsies. Rates of treatment related hypogonadism were 30.8% to 38.5% and 13% to 20% for patients treated with 18 to 20 Gy and cisplatin based chemotherapy, respectively.In patients with a testicular germ cell tumor the risk of having contralateral germ cell neoplasia in situ is 4% to 8%, with a greater risk in patients with testicular atrophy, cryptorchidism or age less than 40 years. The risk is high enough to support use of contralateral testicular biopsy in patients with these risk factors for germ cell neoplasia in situ. However, routine screening is not advised. Radiation therapy with 18 to 20 Gy was associated with much better eradication of germ cell neoplasia in situ than chemotherapy. Chemotherapy may eradicate germ cell neoplasia in situ in up to two-thirds of patients undergoing chemotherapy as adjuvant treatment for a primary germ cell tumor. Further research and data are needed to strengthen many aspects of the evidence base.",0

Yet EDs are often not well prepared to provide end-of-life (EOL) care. The aim of this review was to identify and synthesise studies that describe the views and experiences of emergency nurses in providing EOL care so as to understand the barriers and challenges that they face while caring for these patients and to identify factors that can support appropriate care delivery. Method A qualitative meta-synthesis was undertaken using a thematic approach. Study quality was assessed using the Joanna Briggs Institute Qualitative Assessment and Review Instrument tool. Five databases were searched in June 2016. Results Eleven qualitative studies met the inclusion criteria and were assessed as having high quality. Sixty-nine findings were identified, combined into 11 descriptive themes and then synthesised into 3 analytical themes: (1) Incongruent ED environment and EOL care. (2) Lack of resources, systems and capacity. (3) EOL care as a rewarding act or an emotional burden. Conclusion The review identified a need for: (1) Additional training for nurses. (2) The development of clear guidelines in the form of pathways and protocols. (3) Having a separate space for the dying. (4) Providing a supportive environment for staff dealing with high emotional burden and challenging workloads. In order to improve EOL care, organisations must work on the barriers that hinder care provision.",0

Image guidance has been suggested to improve breach rates, though the radiation risk for AIS precludes its common usage. The purpose of this systematic review and meta-analysis was to compare the breach rates and screw-related complications for AIS patients undergoing spine surgery with pedicle screws between freehand screw insertion and image guidance methods. A comprehensive search of MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, CENTRAL and Web of Science databases was conducted. Two reviewers independently screened abstracts, full-texts, extracted data and performed risk of bias assessment using the QUIPS quality appraisal tool. Level of evidence summary statements were formulated based on consistency and quality of reporting. Ninety-four studies were found, with 18 studies of moderate risk of bias or better. Moderate evidence from two head-to-head studies shows CT guidance has lower breach rates than freehand methods (OR 0.28 [0.20–0.40, I2 = 1%]), with no complications in either study. From individual studies, moderate evidence showed lower breach rates for image guidance versus freehand methods (13%, I2 = 98% vs. 20%, I2 = 95%). Complication rates were conflicting (0–1.6% for image guidance, 0–1.7% for freehand). Moderate evidence showed increased surgical time for image guidance versus freehand (257.7 min vs. 226.8 min). Meta-analyzed breach rates show moderate evidence of decreased breaches with CT navigation compared with freehand methods. Complication rates remain unknown due to the low complication rates from small sample sizes. These slides can be retrieved under Electronic Supplementary Material.",0

There is evidence that smoking causes ‘steroid resistance’ and thus reduces the effect of ICS. This systematic review aimed to investigate the effect of smoking on efficacy of ICS in COPD in terms of lung function and exacerbation rates. Design Systematic review. Data sources An electronic database search of PubMed, Ovid MEDLINE, Ovid Embase and Cochrane Library (January 2000 to January 2020). Eligibility criteria Fully published randomised controlled trials (RCTs), in the English language, evaluating the use of ICS in COPD adults that stratified the participants by smoking status. Trials that included participants with asthma, lung cancer and pneumonia were excluded. The primary outcome measures were changes in lung function and yearly exacerbation rates. Data extraction and synthesis Two independent reviewers extracted data and assessed risk of bias using the Cochrane Collaboration’s tool. Results Seven studies were identified. Four trials (17 892 participants) recorded change in forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV 1 ) from baseline to up to 30 months after starting treatment. Heavier smokers (&gt;36 pack years) using ICS had a greater decline in FEV 1 that ranged from −22 mL to −75 mL in comparison to lighter smokers. Smokers using ICS had mixed results in FEV 1 change: −8 mL to +77 mL in comparison to ex-smokers. Four trials (21 270 participants) recorded difference in COPD exacerbation rates at 52 weeks. The rate ratios favoured more exacerbations in ICS users who were current or heavier smokers than those who were ex-smokers or lighter smokers (0.81 to 0.99 vs 0.92 to 1.29). Conclusions In COPD, heavier or current smokers do not gain the same benefit from ICS use on lung function and exacerbation rates as lighter or ex-smokers do, however effects may not be clinically important.

A meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of workplace interventions was conducted (PROSPERO, CRD42018094083). The PubMed, Scopus, PsycINFO, and Cochrane databases were searched. RCTs from 2000 to 2017 and with employees (18–65 years) were selected. Then, intervention characteristics and work-related outcomes data were extracted. A total of 47 RCTs were included in the systematic review, and 19 RCTs (11 absenteeism, 7 productivity, and 5 work ability) were included in the meta-analysis. The meta-analysis showed that the effectiveness of workplace interventions for absenteeism was −1.56 (95% CI, −2.67 to −0.44) and −2.65 (95% CI, −4.49 to −0.81) considering only moderate quality RCTs. In contrast, only a few studies of workplace interventions for productivity and work ability were included, which was insufficient for determining the effectiveness and best design for improving these work outcomes. The workplace is an interesting environment to reduce absenteeism, and individualized and counseling interventions with &lt;10 sessions/total were the most effective workplace intervention methodological design for reducing the absenteeism of employees.

Although pregnant women comprise a subset of individuals at risk for SJS and TEN development, little is known with regard to outcomes and treatment.This study aimed to conduct a systematic review to characterize the risk factors, outcomes, and treatment of SJS and TEN in pregnant patients and newborns.A primary literature search was conducted using PubMed in September 2019, using the following search terms entered in separate pairs: pregnant or pregnancy and stevens-johnson or SJS or toxic epidermal necrolysis. Reviews, studies in a language other than English, and articles not including pregnant patients were excluded.Twenty-six articles were included for review, including a total of 177 patients. The average maternal age for a reaction was 29.9 years, gestational age was 24.9 weeks, and time to reaction after drug initiation was 27.5 days. Approximately 85% of pregnant women in this review were infected with HIV. The most common causative medications were antiretroviral therapy (90% of all cases), antibiotics (3%), and gestational drugs (2%). Of the 94 cases in which outcome data were available, the survival rates of pregnant women and newborns after delivery were 98% and 96%, respectively. Withdrawal of the offending agent and supportive care was often sufficient for treatment, but antibiotics, steroids, and intravenous immunoglobulin were implemented in some cases. Complications included preterm labor, vaginal stenosis, and vaginal adhesions.Given the predominance of studies focusing on the subset of pregnant patients who are infected with HIV, SJS and TEN is most commonly reported in young patients after antiretroviral therapy, primarily nevirapine. Overall mortality is lower than that of the general population, but similar to the expected mortality rates of younger adults. Early recognition and withdrawal of the offending agent is essential to mitigate the distinct consequences of these conditions in the pregnant population.",0

We conducted a systematic literature review to identify methods for detecting invalid responses to PRO measures. Eight data quality indicators were applied to child-report data collected from 1780 children ages 8–11 years. We grouped children with similar data quality patterns and tested for between-group differences in factors hypothesized to influence self-report capacity. We identified 126 articles that described 494 instances in which special measures or statistical techniques were applied to evaluate data quality at the individual level. We identified 22 data quality indicator subtypes: 9 direct methods (require administration of special items) and 13 archival techniques (statistical procedures applied to PRO data post hoc). Application of archival techniques to child-report PRO data revealed 3 distinct patterns (or classes) of the data quality indicators. Compared to class 1 (56%), classes 2 (36%) and 3 (8%) had greater variation in their PRO item responses. Three archival indicators were especially useful for differentiating plausible item response variation (class 2) from statistically unlikely response patterns (class 3). Neurodevelopmental conditions, which are associated with a range of cognitive processing challenges, were more common among children in class 3. A multi-indicator approach is needed to identify invalid PRO responses. Once identified, assessment environments and measurement tools should be adapted to best support these individuals’ self-report capacity. Individual-level data quality indicators can be used to gauge the effectiveness of these accommodations.",0

The role of the nasal and paranasal sinus cavities is increasingly recognized for COVID-19 symptomatology and transmission. We therefore conducted a systematic review, synthesizing existing scientific evidence about sinonasal pathophysiology in COVID-19.Systematic review.Systematic searches were performed of all indexed studies in PubMed/Medline and Cochrane databases through 28 March 2020 and studies searchable on preprints.com (including ArXiv and Scilit repositories) through 30 March 2020. Data extraction focused on sinonasal pathophysiology in COVID-19.A total of 19 studies were identified. The sinonasal cavity may be a major site of infection by SARS-CoV-2, where susceptibility genes required for infection are expressed at high levels and may be modulated by environmental and host factors. Viral shedding appears to be highest from the nose, therefore reflecting a major source for transmission. This has been highlighted by multiple reports of health care-associated infection (HAI) during rhinologic procedures, which are now consequently considered to be high risk for SARS-CoV-2 transmission to health care workers. While sinonasal symptomatology, such as rhinorrhea or congestion, appears to be a rarer symptom of COVID-19, anosmia without nasal obstruction is reported as highly specific predictor of COVID-19+ patients.Sinonasal pathophysiology is increasingly important in our understanding of COVID-19. The sinonasal tract may be an important site of infection while sinonasal viral shedding may be an important transmission mechanism-including HAI. Anosmia without nasal obstruction may be a highly specific indicator of COVID-19.2a.",0

Dental extraction means that patients are often left with insufficient teeth leading to psychological problems and reducing their quality of life post-radiotherapy. Some clinicians do not advocate the use of dentures in HaNC patients claiming that dentures might lead to soft tissue irritation followed by ORN when constructed on irradiated jaws.This systematic review aimed to investigate the existing evidence regarding the impact of denture use on the development of ORN in HaNC patients post-radiotherapy.This systematic review followed the Preferred Reporting Item for Systematic Review and Meta-analyses (PRISMA) guideline. Three database systems were used: Ovid Medline, EMBASE and PsycINFO. PROSPERO was searched for ongoing or recently completed systematic reviews. The https://ClinicalTrials.gov was searched for ongoing or recently completed trials. The Joanna Briggs Institute critical appraisal tools were used to assess quality of studies being reviewed.Only three retrospective case-control studies were included. Numbers of participants included in the three studies are limited with incomparable types of mucosal dentures. None of the studies described the method of measurement of the exposure (denture use) in a standard, validated and reliable way.The three included studies suggested no link between denture use and development of ORN. However, very little evidence exists and the robustness of the studies is questionable. Well-powered studies are needed.",0

In the current meta-analysis we quantitatively summarized and updated the results of studies regarding the association between TMAO and mortality. A systematic search was performed from PubMed, ProQuest, Scopus, and Embase. All of the studies that evaluated the association between TMAO and mortality were included in the systematic review and meta-analysis. Subgroup analysis and meta-regression were performed to identify the source of heterogeneity. There were 31 230 participants included and the results showed that being in the highest category of TMAO increased the hazard ratio (HR) of mortality by 47%. Moreover, there was a non-linear association between increased TMAO concentrations and HR of mortality. In the current dose-response meta-analysis, we revealed a positive association between TMAO and mortality risk among an adult population.",0

The present systematic review evaluates the extant literature on PTSD in police officers using an international dataset. Methods We employed best-evidence narrative synthesis to evaluate whether PTSD prevalence in police is elevated in comparison to the general population of Canada (8%), which itself has a higher lifetime PTSD prevalence than many other regions and thus serves as a conservative standard of comparison. Results PTSD prevalence in police varied considerably across studies from 0% - 44% (M = 14.87%, Median = 9.2%). Despite this variability, strong evidence exists to suggest PTSD prevalence is elevated in police officers. Examination of possible sources of variability in prevalence outcomes highlighted substantial variability in outcomes due to the selection of measurement tool for assessing PTSD (e.g., DSM vs. IES). Examination of commonly-assessed predictive factors for PTSD risk across the literature showed that individual-difference factors (e.g., age, years of service) bear weak-to-nonexistent relationships with PTSD risk, while incident-specific factors (e.g., severity of exposure) are more strongly and consistently associated with PTSD prevalence. Organizational factors (e.g., low support from supervisor) are at present understudied but important possible contributors to PTSD risk. Conclusions PTSD prevalence is elevated in police officers and appears most strongly related to workplace exposure. Measurement variability remains a critical source of inconsistencies across the literature with drastic implications for accurate detection of officers in need of mental health intervention.",0
https://doi.org/10.1016/j.sleh.2020.04.008,A systematic review of workplace behavioral interventions to promote sleep health in men,"Sleep health is an important aspect of wellbeing and merits incorporation into workplace health promotion programs for employees. Men are a unique population with whom many traditional workplace health promotion programs have had limited success. This systematic review posed the question do workplace health promotion programs improve sleep among men, and what program design features contribute to improving sleep among working men? Databases searched were MEDLINE, EMBASE, the Cochrane Library, CINHAL, Academic Search Complete and Health Source: Nursing/Academic Edition and Google Scholar. Empirical research reporting non-pharmacological behavioral sleep programs and/or interventions for working men were eligible for review. 1049 articles were identified; 15 intervention studies were included: 13 interventions were delivered through workplaces, and two recruited workers to programs delivered outside of work. Interventions incorporated health education, stress reduction/relaxation, and/or physical activity components. Eleven studies reported positive findings for sleep health outcome(s) in men. A moderate level of evidence exists for sleep health programs with physical activity and stress management components. Evidence for the effectiveness of sleep health education programs was mixed. That only one study included a gender-sensitized intervention, where men's preferences shaped the content of a stress-reduction program which resulted in improved sleep quality, attests to the insufficient evidence and lack of gender-specific content and analyses. Next research steps should include considering cultural constructions of masculinity in program design in order to strengthen the appeal and engagement of men, and optimize health benefits for working men.",0

This review evaluated the effectiveness of nutrition interventions in vending machines in the university setting. Ten databases were searched for experimental studies published up to July 2019, evaluating nutrition interventions that aimed to encourage the purchase or consumption of healthier foods and drinks in vending machines in the university setting. In total, 401 articles were identified, and 13 studies were included. Studies were pre-post test (n = 7, 54%), randomized controlled trials (RCTs) (n = 5, 38%), and non-randomized controlled trial (n = 1, 8%). Most studies were from the USA (n = 10, 77%) and were published between 2014 and 2018 (n = 9, 69%). Eight interventions (62%) reported positive change in outcomes, including increased number/proportion of sales or revenue from healthier items (n = 6), improved adherence to guidelines for the ratio of healthy/unhealthy products available (n = 1), and improved consumer perception of items available (n = 1). Effective interventions involved the promotion, reduced pricing, increased availability, and/or optimized product placement of healthier items within vending machines. Strategies to improve the nutritional quality of food and drinks in vending machines are warranted. This may be achieved by making healthier options more available and promoting them; however, more robust intervention studies are needed to determine effectiveness.",0
https://doi.org/10.1136/oemed-2019-105880,"Systematic review of methods used to assess exposure to pesticides in occupational epidemiology studies, 1993–2017","Objective Numerous exposure assessment methods (EAM) exist for investigating health effects of occupational exposure to pesticides. Direct (eg, biomonitoring) and indirect methods (eg, self-reported exposures) are however associated with degrees of exposure misclassification. We systematically reviewed EAM in studies of occupational pesticide exposure. Methods We searched for articles reporting observational epidemiological studies in MEDLINE and Embase published 1993 to 2017. The relative frequency of EAM was analysed according to EAM type (direct and indirect methods), health outcome, study design, study location (country) and specificity of assessment. Temporal trends in EAM were analysed. Results In 1298 included articles 1521 EAM occurrences were documented. Indirect EAM (78.3%), primarily self-reported exposures (39.3%) and job titles assessments (9.5%), were mainly applied in case-control studies (95.0%), in high-income countries (85.0%) and in studies of doctor-diagnosed health outcomes (&gt;85%). Direct EAM (20.8%), primarily biomonitoring of blood (15.6%) or urine (4.7%), were predominantly applied in cross-sectional studies (29.8%), in lower middle-income countries (40.9%) and in studies of neurological (50.0%) outcomes. Between 1993 to 2017 no distinct time trends regarding the ratio indirect to direct methods was seen. Within the category of indirect methods use of self-reported exposures and job exposure matrices increased while assessments by job titles and registers decreased. The use of algorithms showed no trend. The specificity of pesticide assessment increased since studies assessing exposure by using job title as a proxy declined. Assessments of type of pesticide increased. Conclusion Over the last 25 years, the ratio (5:1) of indirect to direct EAM applied in articles on occupational pesticide epidemiology stayed relatively constant; changes were mainly attributable to increasing use of self-reported exposures and job exposure matrices. This review, combined with studies assessing EAM validity, will inform on magnitudes of exposure misclassification and help improve the quality of studies on occupational pesticides exposure.",0

There are several valuable reviews considering some fields of the CCHF aspects. While there is no a systematic review about means and trends of CCHF cases and fatality rate, means and trends of CCHF cases and fatality rates of human occupations involved in CCHF. Therefore, this meta-analysis review performed to highlight and provide a global detailed of the above CCHF aspects. Among 398 collected papers, 173 papers were become this meta-analysis review. The study results confirm that an apparent increasing CCHF cases occurred through the past decades. The trends of annually and periodically CCHF cases and fatality rates were also increased. The means of annually and periodically CCHF cases and fatality rates were 57 and 432 cases, and 10 cases and 32.2 % and 49 cases and 28.8 %, respectively. The means of annually and periodically CCHF fatality rates are about one-tenth of CCHF human cases. The mean of CCHF fatality rates in Africa (22.0 %) is lower than Asia (33.5 %) and Europe (33.8 %). Among occupations involved in CCHF, agricultural (28.9 %), health-care (19.2 %) and slaughterhouse (16.7 %) workers, and farmers (13.9 %) had the maximum CCHF fatality rates in order. Based on literature review of CCHFV S-segment aspects, several clades and genotypes are reported to distribute in Africa, Asia and Europe regions. There are very wide fields to investigate the epidemiology characteristics of CCHFV clades, genotypes and their distribution in the future.",0

This meta-analysis aimed to review the current evidence on perioperative and long-term outcomes of routine caudate lobe resection (CLR) for surgical treatment of hilar CCC. Methods A systematic literature search using MEDLINE, EMBASE and Cochrane databases was performed for studies providing comparative data on perioperative and long-term outcomes of patients undergoing resection for hilar CCC with and without CLR. The MINORS score was used for quality assessment. For time-to-event outcomes hazard ratios (HRs) and associated 95% CI were extracted from identified studies, whereas risk ratios (RRs) were calculated for overall morbidity, mortality, and resection margin status. Meta-analyses were carried out using random-effects models. Results Eight studies involving 1350 patients met the inclusion criteria. The quality of the included studies was low to moderate. CLR resulted in significantly improved overall survival (HR 0.49; 95%CI 0.32–0.75, P  Conclusion CLR is associated with improved long-term survival and negative tumor margins after resection of hilar CCC with no adverse impact on perioperative outcomes. CLR might provide the potential to become a standard-of-care procedure in the surgical management of hilar CCC.",0
https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ctrv.2020.102032,Systemic adjuvant therapy for adult patients at high risk for recurrent melanoma: A systematic review,"<h2>Abstract</h2> Cutaneous melanoma is typically treated with wide local excision and, when appropriate, a sentinel node biopsy. Many patients are cured with this approach but for patients who have cancers with high risk features there is a significant risk of local and distant relapse and death. Interferon-based adjuvant therapy was recommended in the past but had modest results with significant toxicity. Recently, new therapies (immune checkpoint inhibitors and targeted therapies) have been found to be effective in the treatment of patients with metastatic melanoma and many of these therapies have been evaluated and found to be effective in the adjuvant treatment of high risk patients with melanoma. This systematic review of adjuvant therapies for cutaneous and mucosal melanoma was conducted for Ontario Health (Cancer Care Ontario) as the basis of a clinical practice guideline to address the question of whether patients with completely resected melanoma should be considered for adjuvant systemic therapy and which adjuvant therapy should be used.",0
https://doi.org/10.5489/cuaj.6440,Systematic review and meta-analysis of trials evaluating the role of adjuvant radiation after radical prostatectomy for prostate cancer: Implications for early salvage,"Introduction: Recent reports suggest that early salvage radiation (esRT) is non-inferior to adjuvant radiation (aRT) for adverse pathological features at radical prostatectomy. However, aRT was accepted as a standard treatment primarily based on effects on biochemical progression-free survival (bPFS). In order to understand the merits of esRT, the objective was to reassess if aRT vs. observation is associated with improved overall survival (OS).&#x0D; Methods: A systematic review and meta-analysis of published randomized trials evaluating aRT was performed. The primary outcome was OS. Secondary outcomes were metastasis-free survival (MFS), loco-regional recurrence-free survival (RFS), bPFS, and adverse events. We performed a random-effects meta-analysis.&#x0D; Results: Four randomized trials including 2068 patients with a median followup of 8.7–12.6 years were identified. While all trials reported a bPFS benefit, only one reported an OS benefit. Upon meta-analysis, no significant OS benefit was detected with aRT vs. observation (hazard ratio [HR] 0.90; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.61–1.33), although consistent bPFS (HR 0.47; 95% CI 0.41–0.54) and local-RFS (HR 0.54; 95% CI 0.39–0.73) benefits were noted. There is an uncertain MFS benefit with aRT (HR 0.79; 95% CI 0.62–1.01), and the effect is largely driven by one trial with a notable risk of bias. There was also a risk of overtreatment, with 35–60% of patients being biochemical recurrence-free with observation alone. Adverse events risk was greater with aRT vs. observation.&#x0D; Conclusions: Although aRT vs. observation provides a bPFS benefit related to local control, there is no clear OS or MFS benefit, a greater risk of adverse events, and a risk of overtreatment. By extension, these data have implications for patient selection and counselling for esRT.",0
https://doi.org/10.1093/qjmed/hcaa174,Systematic review of methemoglobinemia in acetaminophen poisoning,"Summary Acetaminophen (N-acetyl-p-aminophenol paracetamol (APAP)) toxicity is one of the commonly encountered poisonings by emergency physicians. Methemoglobinemia is an uncommon association and rarely seen in APAP poisoning. The study involves the retrospective analysis of all the published reports on APAP-induced methemoglobinemia from 1968 to 2019. In total, there were 14 cases with nine females and six males. The median age of the study cohort was 59 years. The most common presenting feature was altered mentation (nine patients) followed by cyanosis (three patients). The intent of consumption was therapeutic (seven cases) vs. suicidal (five cases) attempt. In most cases, the dose of APAP consumption was not known. Aspirin, sulfasalazine, benzocaine spray, nitrate preservative, contaminated water, detergents, and so on where the other agents consumed by the patients in addition to APAP before developing methemoglobinemia. The median MethHb level of the study cohort was 15.85%. Patients were treated with NAC, hemodialysis, methylene blue and ascorbic acid and continuous renal replacement therapy in various combinations. Full recovery was seen in nine patients while four patients died. APAP toxicity is a well-known and a common entity with multiple sequelae that presents with a variable spectrum of mild to fulminant multiorgan failure. Awareness of non-classical presentations like methemoglobinemia is essential to ensure timely intervention.",0

The purpose of this systematic review is to synthesize existing research on community- and home-based interventions designed to improve parenting and reduce risk of maltreatment for families with SENs, applying a program logic framework. The review includes studies that used preexperimental, quasi-experimental, and experimental designs. Twelve interventions were identified. Of the nine studies that used more rigorous experimental or quasi-experimental designs, five showed positive effects on at least one parenting or child maltreatment outcome, although some studies showed high risk of bias. Full coherence among the intended participants, theory of change, and program components was observed for only two interventions. The findings suggest a need for more rigorous research to develop and test interventions that are grounded in theory and prior research and that address the unique needs of families with SENs.",0
https://doi.org/10.1016/j.envres.2020.109275,Design and methodology challenges of environment-wide association studies: A systematic review,"Environment-wide association studies (EWAS) are an untargeted, agnostic, and hypothesis-generating approach to exploring environmental factors associated with health outcomes, akin to genome-wide association studies (GWAS). While design, methodology, and replicability standards for GWAS are established, EWAS pose many challenges. We systematically reviewed published literature on EWAS to categorize scope, impact, types of analytical approaches, and open challenges in designs and methodologies. The Web of Science and PubMed databases were searched through multiple queries to identify EWAS articles between January 2010 and December 2018, and a systematic review was conducted following the Preferred Reporting Item for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) reporting standard. Twenty-three articles met our inclusion criteria and were included. For each study, we categorized the data sources, the definitions of study outcomes, the sets of environmental variables, and the data engineering/analytical approaches, e.g. neighborhood definition, variable standardization, handling of multiple hypothesis testing, model selection, and validation. We identified limited exploitation of data sources, high heterogeneity in analytical approaches, and lack of replication. Despite of the promising utility of EWAS, further development of EWAS will require improved data sources, standardization of study designs, and rigorous testing of methodologies.",0
https://doi.org/10.1186/s13012-020-00998-w,Effectiveness of training methods for delivery of evidence-based psychotherapies: a systematic review,"Abstract Background Extensive efforts have been made to train mental health providers in evidence-based psychotherapies (EBPs); there is increasing attention focused on the methods through which providers are trained to deliver EBPs. Evaluating EBP training methods is an important step in determining which methods are most effective in increasing provider skill and improving client outcomes. Methods We searched MEDLINE (Ovid) and PsycINFO for randomized controlled trials published from 1990 through June 2019 that evaluated EBP training methods to determine the effectiveness of EBP training modalities on implementation (provider and cost) and client outcomes. Eligible studies ( N = 28) were evaluated for risk of bias, and the overall strength of evidence was assessed for each outcome. Data was extracted by a single investigator and confirmed by a second; risk of bias and strength of evidence were independently rated by two investigators and determined by consensus. Results Overall, EBP training improved short-term provider satisfaction, EBP knowledge, and adherence compared to no training or self-study of training materials (low to moderate strength of evidence). Training in an EBP did not increase treatment adoption compared to no training or self-study. No specific active EBP training modality was found to consistently increase provider EBP knowledge, skill acquisition/adherence, competence, adoption, or satisfaction compared to another active training modality. Findings were mixed regarding the additive benefit of post-training consultation on these outcomes. No studies evaluated changes in provider outcomes with regards to training costs and few studies reported on client outcomes. Limitations The majority of included studies had a moderate risk of bias and strength of evidence for the outcomes of interest was generally low or insufficient. Few studies reported effect sizes. The ability to identify the most effective EBP training methods was limited by low strength of evidence for the outcomes of interest and substantial heterogeneity among studies. Conclusions EBP training may have increased short-term provider satisfaction, EBP knowledge, and adherence though not adoption. Evidence was insufficient on training costs and client outcomes. Future research is needed on EBP training methods, implementation, sustainability, client outcomes, and costs to ensure efforts to train providers in EBPs are effective, efficient, and durable.

https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bbi.2020.05.026,"Prevalence of depression, anxiety, and insomnia among healthcare workers during the COVID-19 pandemic: A systematic review and meta-analysis","• At least one in five healthcare professionals report symptoms of depression and anxiety. • Almost four in ten healthcare workers experience sleeping difficulties and/or insomnia. • Rates of anxiety and depression were higher for female healthcare workers and nursing staff. • Milder mood symptoms are common and screening should aim to identify mild and sub-threshold syndromes. COVID-19 pandemic has the potential to significantly affect the mental health of healthcare workers (HCWs), who stand in the frontline of this crisis. It is, therefore, an immediate priority to monitor rates of mood, sleep and other mental health issues in order to understand mediating factors and inform tailored interventions. The aim of this review is to synthesize and analyze existing evidence on the prevalence of depression, anxiety and insomnia among HCWs during the Covid-19 outbreak. A systematic search of literature databases was conducted up to April 17th, 2020. Two reviewers independently assessed full-text articles according to predefined criteria. Risk of bias for each individual study was assessed and data pooled using random-effects meta-analyses to estimate the prevalence of specific mental health problems. The review protocol is registered in PROSPERO and is available online. Thirteen studies were included in the analysis with a combined total of 33,062 participants. Anxiety was assessed in 12 studies, with a pooled prevalence of 23·2% and depression in 10 studies, with a prevalence rate of 22·8%. A subgroup analysis revealed gender and occupational differences with female HCPs and nurses exhibiting higher rates of affective symptoms compared to male and medical staff respectively. Finally, insomnia prevalence was estimated at 38·9% across 5 studies. Early evidence suggests that a considerable proportion of HCWs experience mood and sleep disturbances during this outbreak, stressing the need to establish ways to mitigate mental health risks and adjust interventions under pandemic conditions.",0
https://doi.org/10.1055/s-0039-3401832,Use of Augmented Reality in Reconstructive Microsurgery: A Systematic Review and Development of the Augmented Reality Microsurgery Score,"Abstract Background Augmented reality (AR) uses a set of technologies that overlays digital information into the real world, giving the user access to both digital and real-world environments in congruity. AR may be specifically fruitful in reconstructive microsurgery due to the dynamic nature of surgeries performed and the small structures encountered in these operations. The aim of this study was to conduct a high-quality preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses (PRISMA) and assessment of multiple systematic reviews 2 (AMSTAR 2) compliant systematic review evaluating the use of AR in reconstructive microsurgery. Methods A systematic literature search of Medline, EMBASE, and Web of Science databases was performed using appropriate search terms to identify all applications of AR in reconstructive microsurgery from inception to December 2018. Articles that did not meet the objectives of the study were excluded. A qualitative synthesis was performed of those articles that met the inclusion criteria. Results A total of 686 articles were identified from title and abstract review. Five studies met the inclusion criteria. Three of the studies used head-mounted displays, one study used a display monitor, and one study demonstrated AR using spatial navigation technology. The augmented reality microsurgery score was developed and applied to each of the AR technologies and scores ranged from 8 to 12. Conclusion Although higher quality studies reviewing the use of AR in reconstructive microsurgery is needed, the feasibility of AR in reconstructive microsurgery has been demonstrated across different subspecialties of plastic surgery. AR applications, that are reproducible, user-friendly, and have clear benefit to the surgeon and patient, have the greatest potential utility. Further research is required to validate its use and overcome the barriers to its implementation.",0
https://doi.org/10.5271/sjweh.3877,Work-related exposure to violence or threats and risk of mental disorders and symptoms: a systematic review and meta-analysis,"Objective This review aimed to examine systematically the epidemiological evidence linking work-related exposure to violence and threats thereof with risk of mental disorders and mental ill-health symptoms. Methods We searched PubMed, EMBASE, PsycINFO and Web of Science to identify original studies that provide quantitative risk estimates. The evidence was weighted according to completeness of reporting, potential common method bias, and bias due to differential selection and drop out, selective reporting, and misclassification of exposure and outcome. Results We identified 14 cross-sectional and 10 cohort studies with eligible risk estimates, of which 4 examined depressive disorder and reported an elevated risk among the exposed [pooled relative risk (RR) 1.42, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.31-1.54, I 2=0%]. The occurrence of depressive and anxiety symptoms, burnout and psychological distress was examined in 17 studies (pooled RR 2.33, 95% CI 3.17, I 2=42%), and 3 studies examined risk of sleep disturbance (pooled RR 1.22, 95% CI 1.09-1.37, I2=0%). In most studies, common method bias and confounding could not be ruled out with confidence and strong heterogeneity in most outcome definitions invalidate the strict interpretation of most pooled risk estimates. Conclusion The reviewed studies consistently indicate associations between workplace violence and mental health problems. However, due to methodological limitations the causal associations (if any) may be stronger or weaker than the ones reported in this study. Prospective studies with independent and validated reporting of exposure and outcome and repeated follow-up with relevant intervals are highly warranted.",0

The Consensus-based Standards for the selection of health measurement instruments checklist was used to evaluate methodological quality of each included study. The quality criteria adapted by Terwee were applied to extract the results of each measurement property followed by a best evidence synthesis.Results: Twenty-eight articles, including 40 ratings of measurement properties, were included. The combination of the Functional Independence Measure and the Functional Assessment Measure showed moderate evidence of good internal consistency (Cronbach's alpha 0.99), but conflicting evidence of reliability (ICC 0.83) and poor evidence of construct validity. All other instruments showed limited or unknown evidence.Conclusions: This review provides an overview of measurement properties of performance-based instruments and contributes to such methodological considerations before choosing an instrument. Though, the results reveal a lack of high-quality evidence for any of the measurement properties, it is recommended to use tools with the highest possible evidence for positive ratings.Significance: This review contributes with psychometric evidence on instruments to use in occupational therapy practice and research.",0
https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neubiorev.2020.02.017,Twin study designs as a tool to identify new candidate genes for depression: A systematic review of DNA methylation studies,"Monozygotic (MZ) twin studies constitute a key resource for the dissection of environmental and biological risk factors for human complex disorders. Given that epigenetic differences accumulate throughout the lifespan, the assessment of MZ twin pairs discordant for depression offers a genetically informative design to explore DNA methylation while accounting for the typical confounders of the field, shared by co-twins of a pair. In this review, we systematically evaluate all twin studies published to date assessing DNA methylation in association with depressive phenotypes. However, difficulty to recruit large numbers of MZ twin pairs fails to provide enough sample size to develop genome-wide approaches. Alternatively, region and pathway analysis revealed an enrichment for nervous system related functions; likewise, evidence supports an accumulation of methylation variability in affected subjects when compared to their co-twins. Nevertheless, longitudinal studies incorporating known risk factors for depression such as childhood trauma are required for understanding the role that DNA methylation plays in the etiology of depression.",0

To date, there have been no systematic reviews investigating the use of ASMs in clinical practice.A systematic search of electronic databases (CINAHL, the Cochrane Library, Medline, EMBASE, ERIC, and JBI) from inception to March 1, 2018, was undertaken. Gray literature searching (through Google) and pearling was conducted. Methodological quality was assessed using a modified version of the McMaster Critical Appraisal tool for quantitative studies. A customized data extraction tool was developed, which included characteristics of the studies.Of 624 studies, 7 studies met the eligibility criteria. Despite diverse study designs, collectively, the studies demonstrated that only a small number of x-rays did not include an ASM. On x-rays that did use a radiopaque ASM, most of them were positioned in the primary radiation field. A noticeable shift in practice from the use of radiopaque ASMs to digital ASM was also identified. Multifaceted barriers were reported for the use of ASM in routine clinical practice.Although missing ASMs on x-rays were a small feature, findings from this review highlight opportunities for improvement and a need to ameliorate barriers for ASM use.",0

A systematic review and meta-regression analysis,"As a result of the negative impact of bone metastases on patient quality of life, it is important to identify patients at increased risk of skeletal-related events (SREs). Biochemical markers produced by osteoblasts and osteoclasts may provide an early indicator of treatment response to antiresorptive therapy. We aimed to explore the relationship between change in the urinary bone turnover marker cross-linked N-terminal telopeptide of type 1 collagen (uNTX) at the earliest time of steady state and risk of SREs.A comprehensive search of eight bibliographic databases and two trial registries was conducted (June 2017). We included randomized controlled trials of adults (≥18 years old) with bone metastases from solid tumors (including breast, lung, prostate) or bone lesions from multiple myeloma that compared denosumab or bisphosphonate(s) with each other or a placebo. Meta-analyses were used to evaluate the relationship between uNTX and SREs. The primary outcomes were based on uNTX at week 13 and SREs in those studies.Seventeen studies (12,130 patients) were included. The analysis results indicated a positive association between uNTX reduction, measured by the between-group difference of the natural logarithm of the ratio between uNTX at week 13 and baseline, and SRE risk reduction, measured by the natural logarithm of the hazard ratio (HR) for time to first SRE between the two groups (uNTX effect on SRE risk, defined as SRE HR increase corresponding to one unit smaller in the magnitude of uNTX reduction: 0.3560, 95% confidence interval 0.0249-0.6871; P = .0390, R2 = 0.7360). Results were similar for studies that reported change in uNTX from baseline to week 13 and to later than week 13. The limitation of this review is that it depends on how comprehensive study data were that could be included in the meta-regression.Our findings support a positive relationship between reduction of bone turnover markers at the earliest time of steady state and reduction in longer-term risk of SREs.",0

This dose-response meta-analysis was performed to investigate the association between BMI and risk of VTE and PE incidence based on cohort studies. Method A comprehensive systematic search was conducted up to August 2019 in MEDLINE/PubMed, SCOPUS, and Cochrane. DerSimonian and Laird random-effects models were run to estimate combined hazard ratios (HRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Dose-response analysis was also carried out based on BMI values. Results Eleven articles with 16 arms and 3,910,747 participants were eligible for inclusion in this systematic review and meta-analysis. Pooled results showed a positive association between BMI and risk of VTE in the obese participants compared to participants classified in the normal BMI category (HR: 1.62, 95% CI: 1.29–2.04, I2 = 95%). Furthermore, results showed a significant association between lower BMI (underweight versus normal BMI category) and reduced risk of PE (HR: 0.80, 95% CI: 0.70–0.92, I2 = 9%) and higher risk of PE in obese versus normal BMI participants (HR: 2.24, 95% CI: 1.93–2.60, I2 = 0%).

Methods We performed a systematic search in Medline, PubMed, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, EMBASE, CINAHL, International Pharmaceutical Abstracts and bibliographies of relevant articles up to December 2018 for all types of studies that assessed the safety of ceftriaxone in paediatric patients aged ≤18 years. Results 112 studies met the inclusion criteria involving 5717 paediatric patients who received ceftriaxone and reported 1136 ADRs. The most frequent ADRs reported in prospective studies were gastrointestinal (GI) disorders (37.4 %, 292/780), followed by hepatobiliary disorders (24.6%, 192/780). Serious ADRs leading to withdrawal or discontinuation of ceftriaxone were reported in 86 paediatric patients. Immune haemolytic anaemia (34.9%, 30/86) and biliary pseudolithiasis (26.7%, 23/86) were the two major causes. Haemolytic anaemia following intravenous ceftriaxone led to death in 11 children whose primary disease was sickle cell disease. Almost all biliary pseudolithiasis are reversible. However, the incidence was high affecting one in five paediatric patients (20.7%). Conclusions GI ADRs are the most common toxicity of ceftriaxone in paediatric patients. Immune haemolytic anaemia and biliary pseudolithiasis are the most serious ADRs and the major reasons for discontinuation of ceftriaxone. Immune haemolytic anaemia is more likely in children with sickle cell disease and may cause death. Ceftriaxone should be used with caution in children with sickle cell disease.

Although radiation dermatitis is reported by either the clinician or the patient, previous studies have shown disagreement between clinician-reported outcomes (CROs) and patient-reported outcomes (PROs). This review evaluated the extent of discordance between CROs and PROs for radiation dermatitis. Studies reporting both clinician and patient-reported outcomes for external beam RT were eligible. Nine studies met the inclusion criteria for the systematic review, while 8 of these studies were eligible for inclusion in a meta-analysis of acute and late skin toxicities. We found an overall agreement between CROs and PROs of acute skin colour change, fibrosis and/or retraction, and moist desquamation (p > 0.005). Reporting of late breast pain, breast edema, skin colour change, telangiectasia, fibrosis and/or retraction and induration/fibrosis alone (p > 0.005) were also in agreement between clinicians and patients.

Twenty-eight studies with 266,227 cases of lower limb OA were included. Occupational tasks contributing to OA included farming, floor laying, and brick laying. Activities significantly contributing to the risk of knee OA were lifting heavy loads (>10 kg/week) (odds ratio [OR] = 1.52, 95% confidence interval [95%CI] 1.29–1.79), squatting/kneeling (OR = 1.69, 95%CI 1.15–2.49), standing (>2 h/daily) (OR = 1.22 95%CI 1.02–1.46) and walking (OR = 1.40 95%CI 1.14–1.73). Lifting contributed significantly to the risk of hip OA (OR = 1.35, 95%CI 1.16–1.57). The effects of occupational exposures appear to be magnified by previous injury and BMI >25 kg/m2. Since specific occupational activities increase OA risk, ergonomist should encourage the use of existing tools, or oversee the design of new tools that may decrease exposure to such activities.",1

However, the risk of hyperuricemia and gout in different socioeconomic status (SES) remains unclear. Recent studies provided results that contradicted to former studies. We aimed to perform a systematic review and meta-analysis of evidence to date and to assess the associations between SES and hyperuricemia or gout worldwide. We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Web of Science databases to identify studies that investigated the association between SES and hyperuricemia or gout. Studies that presented risk estimates were included. We conducted meta-analyses using random effects to combine unadjusted and adjusted effect estimates. Data from 14 studies were included, 9 provided data about hyperuricemia and 5 provided gout. Overall, there was an association between higher educational level and a higher risk of hyperuricemia (POR = 1.38, 95% CI 1.04–1.73) but lower risk of gout (POR = 0.59, 95% CI 0.47–0.71). Subgroup meta-analysis showed no association between all SES measures and hyperuricemia or gout in males or females. Our study suggested that the associations between SES and hyperuricemia gout are different. Higher educational level was related to a higher risk of hyperuricemia but lower risk of gout. Given the limitations of our study, future studies are needed to investigate specific mechanisms underlying the relationship among SES differences in hyperuricemia and gout. Strategies to prevent and control SES inequalities in hyperuricemia and gout should be explored and adopted.",0

This study was conducted to determine the effectiveness of bright light exposure in shift-worker nurses. We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis according to the preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses (PRISMA) statement and using existing literature in the following databases: Cochrane Library, Embase, PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, to examine any eligible and relevant interventional (randomized controlled trial, experimental and quasi-experimental studies) which were published by December 31, 2018. The obtained documents were analyzed using Stata 14.1 and Cochrane Collaboration's RevMan 5.3. Five studies met eligibility criteria. Results from fixed-effect meta-analysis of the included studies revealed that the exposure could decrease the sleepiness levels, complaints related to shift-work, insomnia and increased the psychomotor error (95% confidence interval (CI): -0.87,-0.43, p=0.000, I2=98.6%), alertness and daytime sleep duration following night shifts (95% CI: 0.08,0.99, p=0.000, I2=92.7%). However, in the random effects model, none of them were statistically significant. Although the results of fixed-effect are in favor of beneficial effects of bright light exposure in shift-worker nurses, the random effects could not approve these findings. Maybe because of either large heterogeneity or insufficiency of the number of studies. Besides, because of the low number of studies, it was impossible to deal with high amount of heterogeneity using subgroup analysis or meta-regression. So the controversy on this topic continues to persist, which highlights the need for more well-designed randomized control trials with larger sample sizes in the future.",0
https://doi.org/10.1111/1750-3841.15135,Ultrasound applications in poultry meat processing: A systematic review,"Ultrasound (US) is classified as a nonthermal treatment and it is used in food processing at a frequency range between 20 kHz and 1 MHz. Cavitation bubbles occur when the US strength is high enough to generate rarefaction that exceeds the intermolecular attraction forces in the medium. Currently, US is widely used in meat industries to enhance procedures, such as meat tenderization, emulsification mass transfer, marination, freezing, homogenization, crystallization, drying, and microorganism inactivation. In addition, combining ultrasonic energy with a sanitizing agent has a synergistic effect on microbial reduction. When poultry meat is treated using US, the expected quality is often better than the traditional methods, such as sanitization and freezing. US can be considered as a novel green technology for tenderizing and decontamination of poultry meat since both Escherichia coli and Salmonella are sensible to US. US improves the physical and chemical properties of meat proteins and can lead to a decrease in the α-helix in intramuscular protease complex in addition to a reduction in the viscosity coefficients. Therefore, ultrasonic treatment can be applied to enhance the textural properties of chicken meat. US can also be used to improve the drying rate when used under vacuum, compared with other traditional techniques. This review focuses on the potential of US applications in the management of poultry industries as the demand for good quality meat proteins is increasing worldwide.",0

Assessment of the identified studies, risk of bias and data extraction were performed independently by two reviewers. The incidence of DRONJ and BRONJ and the RR to develop MRONJ were calculated at 1 year, 2 years and 3 years of exposure. It was also calculated the odds ratio (OR) of their respective prognoses. They were calculated normalizing the values of the individual studies to 1 year, 2 years or 3 years when necessary through robust regression models using a statistical program.From 1.277 references identified, 8 RCTs were included, which comprised a total of 13.857 patients with a variety of neoplasms. The incidence of DRONJ in cancer patients under treatment with denosumab ranged from 0.5 to 2.1% after 1 year, 1.1 to 3.0% after 2 years, and 1.3 to 3.2% after 3 years of exposure. The incidence of BRONJ in cancer patients under treatment with ZA ranged from 0.4 to 1.6% after 1 year of exposure, 0.8 to 2.1% after 2 years, and 1.0 to 2.3% after 3 years of exposure. Statistically significant differences were found between denosumab and ZA in the risk of developing MRONJ after 1, 2 and 3 years of exposure. Nevertheless, there were no significant differences in terms of patient prognosis.Denosumab is associated with a significantly higher risk of developing MRONJ compared to ZA. Nevertheless, no differences were found in its prognoses.",0

We performed a systematic review on the epidemiological studies that have evaluated the association between environmental temperature and human epigenetic modifications. We identified seven original articles on this topic published between 2009 and 2019, including six cohort studies and one cross-sectional study. They focused on DNA methylation in elderly people (blood sample) or infants (placenta sample), with sample size ranging from 306 to 1798. These studies were conducted in relatively low temperature setting (median/mean temperature: 0.8-13 °C), and linear models were used to evaluate temperature-DNA methylation association over short period (≤28 days). It has been reported that short-term ambient temperature could affect global human DNA methylation. A total of 15 candidate genes (ICAM-1, CRAT, F3, TLR-2, iNOS, ZKSCAN4, ZNF227, ZNF595, ZNF597, ZNF668, CACNA1H, AIRE, MYEOV2, NKX1-2 and CCDC15) with methylation status associated with ambient temperature have been identified. DNA methylation on ZKSCAN4, ICAM-1 partly mediated the effect of short-term cold temperature on high blood pressure and ICAM-1 protein (related to cardiovascular events), respectively. In summary, epidemiological evidence about the impacts of environment temperature on human epigenetics remains scarce and limited to short-term linear effect of cold temperature on DNA methylation in elderly people and infants. More studies are needed to broaden our understanding of temperature related epigenetic changes, especially under a changing climate.",1

The magnitude of this risk remains inconclusive. Objective To conduct a meta-analysis of studies that assessed neurodevelopmental outcomes of children aged 0 to 12 years born to opioid-dependent mothers, compared with children born to nonopioid-dependent mothers, across general cognitive, language, motor, and social-emotional domains. Data Sources PubMed, CINAHL, PsycINFO, and Google Scholar databases. Study Eligibility Criteria English-language publications between January 1993 and November 2018, including prenatally opioid-exposed and nonopioid-exposed comparison children, reporting outcomes data on standardized assessments. Study Appraisal and Synthesis Methods Two reviewers independently extracted data. Pooled standardized mean differences (SMDs) were analyzed using random effects models. Risk of bias was assessed with the Newcastle-Ottawa Quality Assessment Scale. Results Across 16 studies, individual domain outcomes data were examined for between 93 to 430 opioid-exposed and 75 to 505 nonopioid-exposed infants/children. Opioid-exposed infants and children performed more poorly than their nonopioid-exposed peers across all outcomes examined, demonstrated by lower infant cognitive (SMD = 0.77) and psychomotor scores (SMD = 0.52), lower general cognition/IQ (SMD = 0.76) and language scores (SMD = 0.65–0.74), and higher parent-rated internalizing (SMD = 0.42), externalizing (SMD = 0.66), and attention problems (SMD = 0.72). Limitations Most studies examined early neurodevelopment; only 3 reported school-age outcomes thereby limiting the ability to assess longer-term impacts of prenatal opioid exposures. Conclusions and Implications of Findings Children born to opioid-dependent mothers are at modest- to high-risk of adverse neurodevelopment at least to middle childhood. Future studies should identify specific clinical and social factors underlying these challenges to improve outcomes.",1

Studies could be randomized controlled trials or observational studies that reported data on any relevant clinical outcomes.In total, 2451 uniquecitations were identified and 35 studies were ultimately included in the systematic review. The overall mean incidence of complications was 3.7% for deep venous thrombosis, 0.0% for pulmonary embolism, and 3.7% for bleeding in chemoprophylaxis group; 2.9% for deep venous thrombosis, 0.4% for pulmonary embolism and 0.0% for bleeding in mechanoprophylaxis; and 0.7% for deep venous thrombosis, 0.1% for pulmonary embolism and 0.2% for bleeding in mixed prophylaxis group with no specific data on these rates for the type of patient and type and location of surgery. None of the articles retrieved provided information on the adolescent population.The poor design and high variability among the studies regarding characteristics of study population, details of interventions, and definitions of outcomes, determines a low quality of the available evidence and limits the interpretation of the results. We were unable to identify a clear advantage of one type of thromboprophylaxis over the other, although there was an increased risk of bleeding with chemoprophylaxis, which could favor the use of mechanoprophylaxis in this scenario.",0

We identified all research evaluating the effect of GAS (gastric acid suppressants) use on patients receiving oral chemotherapy or TKIs for solid tumors. The pooled hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence interval (95%CI) for overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) were calculated with a fixed-effects or a random effects model. The study population included n = 16 retrospective studies and 372,418 patients. The series concerned gastrointestinal tract tumors (n = 5 studies), renal cell carcinomas (RCC, n = 3 studies), non-small cell lung cancers (NSCLC, n = 5 studies), and soft tissue sarcomas or mixed histologies solid tumors in n = 3 studies.

A systematic review and meta-analysis,"Abstract Purpose To perform a systematic review and meta-analysis evaluating usefulness of high-risk CT features (HRFs) on follow-up CT in detecting local recurrence after stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) in lung cancer patients. Methods Pubmed and EMBASE were searched up to January 11th, 2019. We included studies that differentiated local recurrence from post-SBRT changes after SBRT on follow-up CT in lung cancer patients. Methodological quality was assessed using QUADAS-2. The association between HRFs and local recurrence were pooled in the form of odds ratio (OR) using the random effects model. Heterogeneity was examined by the Inconsistency index (I2). Results Eight studies were included, consisting of 356 lung cancer patients. The overall prevalence of patients with local recurrence was 18.8 % (67/356). Compared with post-SBRT changes, local recurrence after SBRT more frequently demonstrated air-bronchogram disappearance (OR = 7.15), bulging margin (OR = 24.12), craniocaudal growth (OR = 26.07), enlargement after 12 months (OR = 28.11), enlarging opacity (OR = 7.92), linear margin disappearance (OR = 29.24), and sequential enlargement (OR = 83.23) (p ≤ 0.02). Pleural effusion appearance was not related with local recurrence (p = 0.82). Heterogeneity varied among HRFs (I2 = 0–91 %). The quality of the studies was considered moderate. Conclusions Several HRFs on follow-up CT after SBRT were useful in suggesting local recurrence. These HRFs may help raise clinical suspicion of local recurrence, initiate prompt additional test for confirmation and perform subsequent proper personalized salvage treatment.",0
https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph17082949,A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis of Associations between Green and Blue Spaces and Birth Outcomes,"Previous studies suggest that green and blue spaces may promote several health outcomes including birth outcomes. However, no synthesis of previous work has specifically asked policy-relevant questions of how much and what type is needed in every neighborhood to elicit these benefits at the population level. A systematic review and meta-analyses were conducted to synthesize thirty-seven studies on the association between residential green and blue spaces and pregnancy outcomes. Meta-analyses were performed for birth weight (BW), small for gestational age (SGA), low birth weight (LBW) and preterm birth (PTB). Increase in residential greenness was statistically significantly associated with higher BW [β = 0.001, 95%CI: (&lt;0.001, 0.002)] and lower odds of SGA [OR = 0.95, 95%CI: (0.92, 0.97)]. Associations between green space and LBW and PTB were as hypothesized but not statistically significant. Associations between blue spaces and pregnancy outcomes were not evident. No study explicitly examined questions of threshold, though some evidence of nonlinearity indicated that moderate amounts of green space may support more favorable pregnancy outcomes. Policy-relevant green and blue space exposures involving theory-driven thresholds warrant testing to ensure future investments in urban greening promote healthier pregnancy outcomes.",1

Yet, concerns remain regarding invasiveness, morbidity, and neurocognitive side effects. Magnetic resonance-guided laser interstitial thermal therapy (MRgLITT) has emerged as a less invasive option for stereotactic ablation rather than resection of the EZ.To provide an introduction to MRgLITT for epilepsy, including historical development, surgical technique, and role in therapy.The development of MRgLITT is briefly recounted. A systematic review identified reported techniques and indication-specific outcomes of MRgLITT for DRE in human studies regardless of sample size or follow-up duration. Potential advantages and disadvantages compared to available alternatives for each indication are assessed in an unstructured review.Techniques and outcomes are reported for mesial temporal lobe epilepsy, hypothalamic hamartoma, focal cortical dysplasia, nonlesional epilepsy, tuberous sclerosis, periventricular nodular heterotopia, cerebral cavernous malformations, poststroke epilepsy, temporal encephalocele, and corpus callosotomy.MRgLITT offers access to foci virtually anywhere in the brain with minimal disruption of the overlying cortex and white matter, promising fewer neurological side effects and less surgical morbidity and pain. Compared to other ablative techniques, MRgLITT offers immediate, discrete lesions with real-time monitoring of temperature beyond the fiber tip for damage estimates and off-target injury prevention. Applications of MRgLITT for epilepsy are growing rapidly and, although more evidence of safety and efficacy is needed, there are potential advantages for some patients.",0

No studies evaluated the benefits or harms of screening. Twenty-five studies (n = 15 785) evaluated the accuracy of screening tests; across individual studies and tests, sensitivity ranged from 0.36 to 1.0 and specificity ranged from 0.49 to 1.0. Among trials reporting findings from general obstetric populations (n = 7953), no significant association was observed between treatment and spontaneous delivery before 37 weeks (pooled absolute risk difference [ARD], -1.44% [95% CI, -3.31% to 0.43%]; 8 RCTs, n = 7571) or any delivery before 37 weeks (pooled ARD, 0.20% [95% CI, -1.13% to 1.53%]; 6 RCTs, n = 6307). Among 5 trials reporting findings among women with a prior preterm delivery, findings were inconsistent; 3 showed a significant beneficial effect, while 2 did not. Maternal adverse events from treatment were infrequent and minor (eg, candidiasis) but were slightly more common with active treatment compared with placebo across 8 RCTs. Two meta-analyses of observational studies reported no significant association between metronidazole exposure and congenital malformations (odds ratio, 0.96 [95% CI, 0.75 to 1.22]; odds ratio, 1.08 [95% CI, 0.90 to 1.29]). One cohort study reported no significantly increased incidence of childhood cancer among metronidazole-exposed children (adjusted relative risk, 0.81 [95% CI, 0.41 to 1.59]). However, studies of in utero exposure had important limitations.Accuracy of screening tests for bacterial vaginosis varies. The evidence suggests no difference in the incidence of preterm delivery and related outcomes from treatment for asymptomatic bacterial vaginosis in a general obstetric population but was inconclusive for women with a prior preterm delivery. Maternal adverse events from treatment appear to be infrequent and minor, but the evidence about harms from in utero exposure was inconclusive.",0
https://doi.org/10.1111/jan.14293,Factors affecting nurses' job satisfaction in rural and urban acute care settings: A PRISMA systematic review,"Aims This review aimed to systematically assess the findings of primary studies to identify the factors associated with nurse job satisfaction in rural and urban contexts while analysing the findings according to Herzberg's theory. Background While there is evidence linking several factors to nurses' job satisfaction, gaps still exist in understanding the differences between factors affecting job satisfaction for nurses working in rural and urban settings. Design Systematic review with narrative summary. Data sources Six databases were used to identify original studies that discuss the factors associated with the nurse's job satisfaction between 1998-2018. Review methods Two authors independently reviewed each study using the Joanna Briggs Institute's critical appraisal checklists. We used the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses statement to report and examine the study biases systematically. Results A total of 38 studies were selected for this review. Physical working environment and authority and freedom were the most frequently reported factors associated with nurses' job satisfaction. Several extrinsic, intrinsic, personal, and community factors were also found to be associated with nurses' job satisfaction. Urban studies tended to focus on extrinsic factors, whereas there was more balance between the two sets of factors in rural studies. Conclusion Both intrinsic and extrinsic factors play an essential role in nurses' job satisfaction. Future research should use more robust research methods and pay more attention to contrasting rural and urban contexts. Herzberg's theory can provide conceptual clarity when investigating the factors associated with nurses' job satisfaction. Impact This review discussed the factors associated with nurses' job satisfaction in rural and urban settings. The findings linked several extrinsic and intrinsic factors to nurses' job satisfaction. Nursing management should search for the perfect blend of intrinsic and extrinsic factors based on nurses' needs and organizational commitment to improve nurses' job satisfaction.",0

The effectiveness of contact investigations and preventive therapy remains poorly understood.In this systematic review and meta-analysis, we investigated the development of tuberculosis in children closely exposed to a tuberculosis case and followed for incident disease. We restricted our search to cohort studies published between Jan 1, 1998, and April 6, 2018, in MEDLINE, Web of Science, BIOSIS, and Embase electronic databases. Individual-participant data and a pre-specified list of variables were requested from authors of all eligible studies. These included characteristics of the exposed child, the index case, and environmental characteristics. To be eligible for inclusion in the final analysis, a dataset needed to include: (1) individuals below 19 years of age; (2) follow-up for tuberculosis for a minimum of 6 months; (3) individuals with household or close exposure to an individual with tuberculosis; (4) information on the age and sex of the child; and (5) start and end follow-up dates. Studies assessing incident tuberculosis but without dates or time of follow-up were excluded. Our analysis had two primary aims: (1) estimating the risk of developing tuberculosis by time-period of follow-up, demographics (age, region), and clinical attributes (HIV, tuberculosis infection status, previous tuberculosis); and (2) estimating the effectiveness of preventive therapy and BCG vaccination on the risk of developing tuberculosis. We estimated the odds of prevalent tuberculosis with mixed-effects logistic models and estimated adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) for incident tuberculosis with mixed-effects Poisson regression models. The effectiveness of preventive therapy against incident tuberculosis was estimated through propensity score matching. The study protocol is registered with PROSPERO (CRD42018087022).In total, study groups from 46 cohort studies in 34 countries-29 (63%) prospective studies and 17 (37%) retrospective-agreed to share their data and were included in the final analysis. 137 647 tuberculosis-exposed children were evaluated at baseline and 130 512 children were followed for 429 538 person-years, during which 1299 prevalent and 999 incident tuberculosis cases were diagnosed. Children not receiving preventive therapy with a positive result for tuberculosis infection had significantly higher 2-year cumulative tuberculosis incidence than children with a negative result for tuberculosis infection, and this incidence was greatest among children below 5 years of age (19·0% [95% CI 8·4-37·4]). The effectiveness of preventive therapy was 63% (adjusted HR 0·37 [95% CI 0·30-0·47]) among all exposed children, and 91% (adjusted HR 0·09 [0·05-0·15]) among those with a positive result for tuberculosis infection. Among all children <5 years of age who developed tuberculosis, 83% were diagnosed within 90 days of the baseline visit.The risk of developing tuberculosis among exposed infants and young children is very high. Most cases occurred within weeks of contact investigation initiation and might not be preventable through prophylaxis. This suggests that alternative strategies for prevention are needed, such as earlier initiation of preventive therapy through rapid diagnosis of adult cases or community-wide screening approaches.National Institutes of Health.",0

Thus, the present study was performed to collect and summarize the latest information about this issue in a systematic way.An exhaustive literature search was carried out using relevant keywords. Web of Sciences, PubMed, Scopus, and Google scholar were interrogated until 30 June 2019. Case-control, cohort, cross-sectional, clinical trial, case report, and animal studies that focused on the objective of the study were retrieved. This review summarizes the results of 761 papers on glycemic changes due to tramadol exposure. Thirty-six publications reported hypoglycemia and 17 hyperglycemia during tramadol use. Twenty-two studies either reported normal blood glucose concentrations, or did not observe any difference in the blood glucose levels following tramadol use. Finally, hypoglycemia was reported in diabetic individuals exposed to tramadol in 12 studies.The data suggest that primarily hypoglycemia but some degree of hyperglycemia has been reported with tramadol use. Importantly, all studies on tramadol use in diabetes reported hypoglycemia. Tramadol-induced hypoglycemia may be severe in some cases. The risk of alterations in glucose homeostasis accompanying tramadol exposure indicates time importance of careful blood glucose monitoring during tramadol use.",0

Previously, we conducted a systematic review to report the estimated prevalence of osteoporosis among patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) from 2001 to 2016. However, some newer studies have been reported, and more potential risk factors for osteoporosis remain controversial and vague. Therefore, the presented review is tailored to synthesize available evidence regarding the pooled prevalence and related risk factors of osteoporosis among T2DM patients in mainland China.Both cross-sectional study and cohort study reporting on the prevalence of osteoporosis among patients with T2DM in mainland China, published in Chinese or English, will be considered for inclusion. Records from 4 English databases and 2 Chinese databases will be retrieved from their inceptions to March 2020. The process of study selection, data extraction, and methodologic quality assessment will be independently executed by 2 reviewers. The pooled prevalence of osteoporosis and the prevalence in the exposed and unexposed groups for each potential risk factor will be calculated by the software Stata version 12.0.The current systematic review and meta-analysis will provide more precise prevalence rates and associated risk factors of osteoporosis among people with T2DM in mainland China.The study will offer high-quality and explicit evidence for assisting diabetic patients to prevent osteoporosis in mainland China.DOI 10.17605/OSF.IO/5ZKJ6.",0
https://doi.org/10.1016/j.envint.2020.105500,"PM2.5 and NO2 exposure errors using proxy measures, including derived personal exposure from outdoor sources: A systematic review and meta-analysis","The use of proxy exposure estimates for PM2.5 and NO2 in air pollution studies instead of personal exposures, introduces measurement error, which can produce biased epidemiological effect estimates. Most studies consider total personal exposure as the gold standard. However, when studying the effects of ambient air pollution, personal exposure from outdoor sources is the exposure of interest.We assessed the magnitude and variability of exposure measurement error by conducting a systematic review of the differences between personal exposures from outdoor sources and the corresponding measurements for ambient concentrations in order to increase understanding of the measurement error structures of the pollutants.We reviewed the literature (ISI Web of Science, Medline, 2000-2016) for English language studies (in any age group in any location (NO2) or Europe and North America (PM2.5)) that reported repeated measurements over time both for personal and ambient PM2.5 or NO2 concentrations. Only a few studies reported personal exposure from outdoor sources. We also collected data for infiltration factors and time-activity patterns of the individuals in order to estimate personal exposures from outdoor sources in every study.Studies using modelled rather than monitored exposures were excluded. Type of personal exposure monitor was assessed. Random effects meta-analysis was conducted to quantify exposure error as the mean difference between ""true"" and proxy measures.Thirty-two papers for PM2.5 and 24 for NO2 were identified. Outdoor sources were found to contribute 44% (range: 33-55%) of total personal exposure to PM2.5 and 74% (range: 57-88%) to NO2. Overall estimates of personal exposure (24-hour averages) from outdoor sources were 9.3 μg/m3 and 12.0 ppb for PM2.5 and NO2 respectively, while the corresponding difference between these exposures and the ambient concentrations (i.e. the measurement error) was 5.72 μg/m3 and 7.17 ppb. Our findings indicated also higher error variability for NO2 than PM2.5. Large heterogeneity was observed which was not explained sufficiently by geographical location or age group of the study sample.Relying only on information available in published studies led to some limitations: the contribution of outdoor sources to total personal exposure for NO2 had to be inferred, individual variation in exposure misclassification was unavailable and instrument error could not be addressed. The larger magnitude and variability of errors for NO2 compared with PM2.5 has implications for biases in the health effect estimates of multi-pollutant epidemiological models. Results suggest that further research is needed regarding personal exposure studies and measurement error bias in epidemiological models.",0

While there is a solid empirical foundation to support CBT as an evidence-based treatment for childhood ADs, the mechanisms underlying the efficacy of CBT are not well explored. Exposure is assumed to be vital to the efficacy of CBT in ADs, but empirical evidence (e.g., dismantling studies) showing that exposure is indeed a vital element of effective treatments is relatively scarce. The proposed meta-analysis aims to investigate the role of exposure in reducing symptoms of anxiety among children and adolescents. Methods A systematic search of several electronic databases including PubMed/MEDLINE, PsycINFO, Psyndex plus, Web of Science, Scopus, and EMBASE will be conducted (from inception onwards). We will include randomized and non-randomized clinical trials examining exposure and anxiety among children and adolescents. If feasible, we will also include experimental, quasi-experimental, and observational studies. The primary outcome will be improvement in anxiety levels (recovery or change in anxiety rating scale) after exposure. Three reviewers will independently screen all citations, abstract data, and full-text articles. The methodological quality (or risk of bias) of individual studies will be appraised using an appropriate tool. If feasible, we will conduct mixed effects meta-analysis. Additional analyses will be conducted to explore the potential sources of heterogeneity (e.g., dose of exposure, age group, methodological quality). Discussion This systematic review and meta-analysis will examine the role of exposure in reducing symptoms of anxiety among youth. The review will provide information on the working mechanisms underlying the efficacy of CBT. Our findings will be of interest to mental health professionals, researchers, and policy makers who wish to support children and adolescents with anxiety disorders by guiding well-informed treatment decisions.

Design: Four databases (PubMed, PsychInfo, Web of Science and SCIelo) were used to retrieve relevant articles using an open timeframe. Articles were reviewed if they contained a systematic measure (i.e. food checklist) of the food environment (e.g. food availability) and dietary intake. Setting: Urban and rural communities in Mexico. Participants: Population-based studies of Mexican communities. Results: Twenty studies that assessed at least one food environment level, and at least one dietary outcome, were reviewed. Findings from these studies showed that changes in the Mexican food environment seem to be associated with higher availability of energy-dense foods. Energy-dense foods can be linked to a high consumption in household, environment and community food environments. When both nutrient-dense and energy-dense foods were present, individuals were more likely to consume foods with added sugars, fats and salt options than nutrient-dense items. Conclusions: The various levels of the food environment (i.e. household, school, community) exposed participants to energy-dense foods. Although nutrient-dense foods were present in all three levels, individuals were more likely to consume energy-dense food items. Not all three levels of the food environment are well represented in the urban and rural settings. Most studies on the community food environment were done in rural areas, whereas most studies on the school food environment were done in urban settings. Additional rigorously designed studies are needed to document the relationship between the food environment and dietary intake in the Mexican population.",0
https://doi.org/10.1093/nop/npaa012,Use of virtual reality for symptom management in solid-tumor patients with implications for primary brain tumor research: a systematic review,"Primary brain tumors (PBTs) remain incurable, with a typically poor prognosis and significant symptom burden for patients. Virtual reality (VR) can potentially alleviate some of the negative aspects of illness by allowing individuals to escape to environments where they can experience more positive thoughts and emotions. Given promising findings for VR use in other clinical populations, there is increasing interest to use VR for symptomatic improvement in oncology patients. The purpose of this review was to analyze the literature of VR-related interventions for symptom management in adult PBT and other solid-tumor patients, which will guide development of future VR interventions in these populations.A systematic search of EMBASE, PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science was performed using PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) guidelines with predefined eligibility criteria. Thirteen studies met the inclusion criteria and were selected for review.Findings showed promising evidence that VR can improve anxiety for solid-tumor patients, with mixed results reported for pain, distress, depression, and mood. There was significant heterogeneity in methodological approaches across the literature and the majority of studies were underpowered and lacked rigorous study designs. Qualitative findings demonstrated a high degree of participant satisfaction with VR use, with very few adverse side effects reported.Findings from this review suggest that VR can be used as an innovative delivery system for targeted interventions to improve symptoms in PBTs and other solid-tumor patient populations, though additional well-designed clinical trials are needed to better establish its efficacy.",0

Interpretation of this finding is challenging given the high incidence of LBP in the general population that is not exposed to a MVC. Risk studies with comparison control groups need to be examined in a systematic review.A systematic search of five electronic databases from 1998 to 2019 was performed. Eligible studies describing exposure to a MVC and risk of future non-specific LBP were critically appraised using the Quality in Prognosis Studies (QUIPS) instrument. The results were summarized using best-evidence synthesis principles, a random effects meta-analysis and testing for publication bias.The search strategy yielded 1136 articles, three of which were found to be at low to medium risk of bias after critical appraisal. All three studies reported a positive association between an acute injury in a MVC and future LBP. Pooled analysis of the results resulted in an unadjusted relative risk of future LBP in the MVC-exposed and injured population versus the non-exposed population of 2.7 (95 % CI [1.9, 3.8]), which equates to a 63 % attributable risk under the exposed.There was a consistent positive association in the critically reviewed literature that investigated the risk of future LBP following an acute MVC-related injury. For the patient with chronic low back pain who was initially injured in a MVC, more often than not (63 % of the time) the condition was caused by the MVC. These findings are likely to be of interest to clinicians, insurers, patients, governments and the courts. Future studies from both general and clinical populations would help strengthen these results.",0

MEDLINE, Embase, and Cochrane Library databases were searched up to June 2019. Studies were selected if they reported data that could be used to construct contingency tables to compare 18F-FDG PET/CT, WB-MRI, and WB-DWI. Two authors independently extracted data on study characteristics and assessed methodological quality using the Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies. Forest plots were generated for sensitivity and specificity of 18F-FDG PET/CT, WB-MRI, and whole-body diffusion-weighted imaging (WB-DWI). Summary receiver operating characteristic plots were created. The 4 studies meeting inclusion criteria had a total of 564 patients and 559 lesions, 233 of which were metastases. In studies of 18F-FDG PET/CT, the pooled estimates of sensitivity and specificity were 0.83 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.54–0.95) and 0.93 (95% CI, 0.87–0.96), respectively. For WB-MRI, pooled sensitivity was 0.92 (95% CI, 0.18–1.00) and pooled specificity was 0.93 (95% CI, 0.85–0.95). Pooled sensitivity and specificity for WB-DWI were 0.78 (95% CI, 0.46–0.93) and 0.91 (95% CI, 0.79–0.96), respectively. There was no statistical difference between the diagnostic odds ratio of WB-MRI and WB-DWI compared with that of PET/CT (p = 0.186 for WB-DWI; p = 0.638 for WB-MRI). WB-MRI and DWI are radiation-free alternatives with comparable diagnostic performance to 18F-FDG PET/CT for M staging of NSCLC. • Whole-body MRI with or without diffusion-weighted imaging has a high accuracy for the diagnostic evaluation of metastases in patients with non–small cell lung cancer.  • Whole-body MRI may be used as a non-invasive and radiation-free alternative to positron emission tomography with CT with similar diagnostic performance.",0

Both intrinsic and environmental factors may contribute to reduced sleep quality. Poor sleep quality has been reported to be associated with poorer rehabilitation outcomes. The aim of this review was (1) to describe the prevalence of sleep disturbance or disorder among older people participating in inpatient rehabilitation, and (2) to describe interventions that have been trialed to increase sleep quality and/or quantity in older people in rehabilitation settings and report on their efficacy. Design Systematic review involving search of 3 electronic databases and gray literature. Two authors independently reviewed citations and reviewed full text and agreed on included studies. Data were extracted and synthesized and risk of bias was assessed. Setting and Participants Studies were included if they provided quantitative data about the prevalence of sleep disturbance or disorder in older people in a rehabilitation setting or if they reported the results of a randomized trial evaluating an intervention to improve sleep quality in older people in a rehabilitation setting. Measures Studies were included if they reported data from monitoring (such as polysomnography or actigraphy), clinical assessments, or questionnaires. Results 16 studies reporting prevalence data and 3 studies reporting evaluations of interventions were included in this review. Studies reported data from stroke and mixed population rehabilitation settings. The prevalence of obstructive sleep apnea was high and ranged from 12% to 92% in stroke rehabilitation settings. Other types of sleep disturbance, such as difficulty initiating sleep, were also common. Conclusions and Implications Many older people participating in inpatient rehabilitation have sleep disturbance or sleep disorders. Poor sleep quality is associated with poorer health status and recovery; therefore, it is important that rehabilitation settings take steps to enhance sleep quality for inpatients drawing on the principles of good sleep hygiene.",0

The aim of this study was to appraise the morbidity following PDO through a systematic review and meta-analysis.A systematic search of MEDLINE, Embase, and Web Of Science identified studies reporting outcomes of PDO following pancreaticoduodenectomy. Pooled prevalence rates of postoperative complications and mortality were computed using random-effect modeling. Meta-regression analyses were performed to examine the impact of moderators on the overall estimates.Sixteen studies involving 1000 patients were included. Pooled postoperative mortality was 2.7%. A POPF was reported in 29.7% of the patients. Clinically relevant POPFs occurred in 13.5% of the patients, while intra-abdominal abscess and haemorrhages occurred in 6.7% and 5.5% of the patients, respectively. Re-operation was necessary in 7.6% of the patients. Postoperatively new onset diabetes occurred in 15.8% of patients, more frequently after the use of chemical substances for PDO (p = 0.003).PDO is associated with significant morbidity including new onset of post-operative diabetes. The risk of new onset post-operative diabetes is associated with the use of chemical substance for PDO. Further evidence is needed to evaluate the potential benefits of PDO in patients at high risk of POPF.",0

Maternal use of benzodiazepines during pregnancy is common and has increased over the last decades. In this systematic review and meta-analysis, we studied the literature to estimate the worldwide use of benzodiazepines before, during and after pregnancy, which could help to estimate benzodiazepine exposure and to prioritize and guide future investigations. We systematically searched Embase, Medline Ovid, Web of Science and Cochrane Central up until July 2019 for studies reporting on benzodiazepine use before (12 months), during and after pregnancy (12 months). Random effects meta-analysis was conducted to calculate pooled prevalence estimates, as well as stratified according to substantive variables. We identified 32 studies reporting on 28 countries, together reporting on 7,343,571 pregnancies. The worldwide prevalence of benzodiazepine use/prescriptions during pregnancy was 1.9% (95%CI 1.6%-2.2%; I 2 97.48%). Highest prevalence was found in the third trimester (3.1%; 95%CI 1.8%-4.5%; I 2 99.83%). Lorazepam was the most frequently used/prescribed benzodiazepine (1.5%; 95%CI 0.5%-2.5%; I 2 99.87%). Highest prevalence was found in Eastern Europe (14.0%; 95%CI 12.1%-15.9%; I 2 0.00%). All analyses revealed considerable heterogeneity. Our meta-analysis confirmed that benzodiazepine use before, during and after pregnancy is prevalent. The relatively common use of benzodiazepines with possible risks for both mother and (unborn) child is worrying and calls for prescription guidelines for women, starting in the preconception period. Given the substantial proportion of children exposed to benzodiazepines in utero, future research should continue to study the short- and long-term safety of maternal benzodiazepine use during pregnancy and to explore non-pharmacological alternative treatments.",0

There are many frailty-screening tools with different components. The prognostic value of the individual parameters in frailty is as yet unclear. The objective of this systematic review and meta-analysis was to find and pool predictors for 1‑year mortality after TAVI. We followed a two-step approach. First, we searched for randomised controlled trials on TAVI to identify frailty parameters used in these studies. Second, we searched for publications on these frailty parameters. Articles were included for pooled analysis if the studied frailty parameters were dichotomised with clear cut-off values based on common standards or clinical practice and reported adjusted hazard ratios (HR) of 1‑year mortality after TAVI. We calculated pooled effect estimates of 49 studies based on dichotomised frailty scores (HR: 2.16, 95% CI: 1.57–3.00), chronic lung disease (HR: 1.57, 95% CI: 1.45–1.70), estimated glomerular filtration rate &lt;30 ml/min (HR: 1.95, 95% CI: 1.68–2.29), body mass index &lt;20 kg/m 2 (HR: 1.49, 95% CI: 1.09–2.03), hypoalbuminaemia (HR: 1.77, 95% CI: 1.38–2.25), anaemia (HR: 2.08, 95% CI: 0.93–4.66), low gait speed (HR: 13.33, 95% CI: 1.75–101.49) and Katz activities of daily living (ADL) score of 1 or more deficits (HR: 5.16, 95% CI: 0.77–34.47).

Two authors independently extracted outcome estimates and assessed study quality.We estimated hazard ratios (HRs) using random effect restricted cubic spline dose-response meta-analyses. Compared with the recommended level of physical activity (750 MET min/week), mortality risk was lower at physical activity levels exceeding the recommendations, at least until 5000 MET min/week for all cause mortality (HR=0.86, 95% CI 0.78 to 0.94) and for CVD mortality (HR=0.73, 95% CI 0.56 to 0.95).The strengths of this study include the detailed dose-response analyses, inclusion of 48 studies and examination of sources of heterogeneity. The limitations include the observational nature of the included studies and the inaccurate estimations of amount of physical activity.Compared with the recommended level, mortality risk was lower at physical activity levels well above the recommended target range. Further, there was no threshold beyond which lifespan was compromised.PROSPERO CRD42017055727.",0

We report here a systematic overview of the published data evaluating NLR as a prognostic factor or predictive factor for pathological complete response (PCR) and toxicity in early and advanced BC. A total of 45 articles were identified. NLR was found to be an independent prognostic factor for survival in most of the adjuvant treatment studies. However, no significant correlation was found between survival and NLR for early BC patients receiving neo-adjuvant chemotherapy (NACT) and advanced BC patients. Most studies failed to find a significant correlation between NLR and PCR after NACT. Finally, some data showed that IBM could be predictive of chemotherapy-related toxicity.",0

Nurses play a key role in the public health response to such crises, delivering direct patient care and reducing the risk of exposure to the infectious disease. The experience of providing nursing care in this context has the potential to have significant short and long term consequences for individual nurses, society and the nursing profession.To synthesize and present the best available evidence on the experiences of nurses working in acute hospital settings during a pandemic.This review was conducted using the Joanna Briggs Institute methodology for systematic reviews.A structured search using CINAHL, MEDLINE, EMBASE, PubMed, Google Scholar, Cochrane Library, MedNar, ProQuest and Index to Theses was conducted.All studies describing nurses' experiences were included regardless of methodology. Themes and narrative statements were extracted from included papers using the SUMARI data extraction tool from Joanna Briggs Institute.Thirteen qualitative studies were included in the review. The experiences of 348 nurses generated a total of 116 findings, which formed seven categories based on similarity of meaning. Three synthesized findings were generated from the categories: (i) Supportive nursing teams providing quality care; (ii) Acknowledging the physical and emotional impact; and (iii) Responsiveness of systematised organizational reaction.Nurses are pivotal to the health care response to infectious disease pandemics and epidemics. This systematic review emphasises that nurses' require Governments, policy makers and nursing groups to actively engage in supporting nurses, both during and following a pandemic or epidemic. Without this, nurses are likely to experience substantial psychological issues that can lead to burnout and loss from the nursing workforce.",0

Studies of the metabolism of synthetic compounds, herbal medicines/supplements, and herb-derived bioactive compounds are therefore challenging. The aim of the present review is to provide a summary of the approaches/techniques that are currently being employed to investigate different aspects of the metabolism of herbs and herb-derived compounds (reaction phenotyping, metabolite profiling, metabolic clearance prediction, metabolic/pharmacokinetic drug interactions, and metabolism-related pharmacokinetic studies), including their limitations. A thorough search of the PubMed database was performed using the terms ‘Cancer’ AND ‘Cytochrome P450 (CYP)’ OR ‘Phase I metabolism’ OR ‘Phase II metabolism’ AND ‘Natural product’ OR ‘Herbal medicine’ OR ‘Herbal product’ OR ‘Herb-derived compound.’ Most of the studies (84 studies, 83.2%) retrieved during the search investigated metabolic/pharmacokinetic drug interactions. Three (3.0%), 7 (6.9%), 6 (5.9%), and 1 (1.0%) study involved metabolism-related pharmacokinetic studies, reaction phenotyping, metabolite profiling, and prediction of metabolic clearance, respectively. Various studies reported conflicting results, with the results depending on the nature of the herb investigated (extracts or active constituents) and the biochemical tool (subcellular fractions, cells, or recombinant enzymes) and study system (in vitro/in vivo/ex vivo/clinical) applied. Each approach/system has its own advantages and disadvantages. Selecting the most appropriate approaches/systems allows us to extract the most meaningful and clinically relevant information on the metabolic pathways (the metabolites generated and the enzymes involved) and the potential drug interactions of herb-derived compounds for cancer therapy and prevention. Human primary hepatocytes are the best model that can be applied in any metabolic study. Human liver microsomes (HLMs) are a useful biochemical tool for preliminary drug metabolism studies. Recombinant microsomes that express specific enzymes and CYP-isoform-specific monoclonal antibodies are useful tools for enzyme inhibition studies.",0

Methods We systematically reviewed PubMed/MEDLINE, Embase, and Cochrane Library. The primary endpoint was 2-year overall survival (OS); secondary endpoints were grade >3 complications and response rate. Results We included 10 studies involving 575 patients (only 12% of whom underwent salvage surgery post-recurrence) with RSHNC who underwent SBRT; median SBRT reirradiation doses ranged from 24 to 44 Gy (median, 30 Gy) delivered with 3–6 fractions (median, 5 fractions). Median target volume of SBRT reirradiation was measured from 19 to 103 cm3. The pooled event rate of 2-year OS following SBRT reirradiation for RSHNC was 30.0% (95% confidence interval [CI] 24.5–36.1). The pooled rates of late grade ≥3 and grade 5 toxicity were 9.6% (95% CI 5.0–17.6) and 4.6% (95% CI 2.4–8.6), respectively. Grade 5 toxicity was not observed in five studies (range: 0–10.7%). The pooled rates of clinical response and complete response were 61.7% (95% CI 51.1–71.3) and 31.3% (95% CI 23.3–40.5), respectively, and the 2-year local control rate was 47.3% (95% CI 3.1–62.1). Conclusions SBRT with median 30 Gy in 5 fractions is a feasible therapy showing good responses for patients with RSHNC not suitable for salvage surgery. However, to improve OS, SBRT reirradiation strategy should be investigated in terms of dose escalation for sustained control and combined systemic therapy.",0

In recent decades, miRNAs have attracted increasing interest to explore the role of epigenetics in response to air pollution. Air pollution, which always contains kinds of particulate matters, are able to reach respiratory tract and blood circulation and then causing epigenetics changes. In addition, extensive studies have illustrated that miRNAs serve as a bridge between particulate matter exposure and health-related effects, like inflammatory cytokines, blood pressure, vascular condition and lung function. The purpose of this review is to summarize the present knowledge about the expression of miRNAs in response to particulate matter exposure. Epidemiological and experimental studies were reviewed in two parts according to the size and source of particles. In this review, we also discussed various functions of the altered miRNAs and predicted potential biological mechanism participated in particulate matter-induced health effects. More rigorous studies are worth conducting to understand contribution of particulate matter on miRNAs alteration and the etiology between environmental exposure and disease development. • The first systematic review to summarize present studies about the expression of miRNAs in response to PMs exposure. • Studies were reviewed in two parts according to different size and components of particles. • We discussed various functions of the altered miRNAs and predicted their potential biological mechanism.",1
https://doi.org/10.1038/s41380-019-0601-3,Epigenetic mechanisms in schizophrenia and other psychotic disorders: a systematic review of empirical human findings,"Schizophrenia and other psychotic disorders are highly debilitating psychiatric conditions that lack a clear etiology and exhibit polygenic inheritance underlain by pleiotropic genes. The prevailing explanation points to the interplay between predisposing genes and environmental exposure. Accumulated evidence suggests that epigenetic regulation of the genome may mediate dynamic gene–environment interactions at the molecular level by modulating the expression of psychiatric phenotypes through transcription factors. This systematic review summarizes the current knowledge linking schizophrenia and other psychotic disorders to epigenetics, based on PubMed and Web of Science database searches conducted according to the PRISMA guidelines. Three groups of mechanisms in case–control studies  of human tissue (i.e., postmortem brain and bio-fluids) were considered: DNA methylation, histone modifications, and non-coding miRNAs. From the initial pool of 3,204 records, 152 studies met our inclusion criteria (11,815/11,528, 233/219, and 2,091/1,827 cases/controls for each group, respectively). Many of the findings revealed associations with epigenetic modulations of genes regulating neurotransmission, neurodevelopment, and immune function, as well as differential miRNA expression (e.g., upregulated miR-34a, miR-7, and miR-181b). Overall, actual evidence moderately supports an association between epigenetics and schizophrenia and other psychotic disorders. However, heterogeneous results and cross-tissue extrapolations call for future work. Integrating epigenetics into systems biology may critically enhance research on psychosis and thus our understanding of the disorder. This may have implications for psychiatry in risk stratification, early recognition, diagnostics, precision medicine, and other interventional approaches targeting epigenetic fingerprints.",0
https://doi.org/10.1093/ecco-jcc/jjz163,"Systematic Review: Clinical Utility of Gastrointestinal Ultrasound in the Diagnosis, Assessment and Management of Patients With Ulcerative Colitis","Abstract Background and Aims Gastrointestinal ultrasound is useful in the assessment of patients with Crohn’s disease, but its application in ulcerative colitis [UC] is less well established. Here we systematically review the role of gastrointestinal ultrasound in patients with UC. Methods Searches of the PUBMED and EMBASE databases were performed with the following search strategy: [ultrasound OR sonography] AND [intestinal OR bowel] AND [ulcerative colitis OR inflammatory bowel disease]. The final search was performed in August 2019. Results Of 6769 studies identified in the search with a further two studies found from other sources, 50 studies met the inclusion criteria. Increased bowel wall thickness and detection of increased blood flow by colour Doppler were the most often applied criteria for defining disease activity and distribution. When compared with other reference investigations, gastrointestinal ultrasound accurately determined disease extent, severity and response to medical therapy. While further information can be obtained from haemodynamic measurements of the abdominal vessels and contrast-enhanced ultrasound, their clinical value was uncertain. Likewise, hydrocolonic sonography has few advantages over standard gastrointestinal ultrasound examination. Of several scoring systems proposed, there is disparity between the measures and a general lack of validation. There has been limited application of gastrointestinal ultrasound in acute severe ulcerative colitis with toxic megacolon, and, while performing well in children, normal limits differ from those in adults. Conclusion Current evidence indicates that gastrointestinal ultrasound has utility in the non-invasive assessment of patients with UC. Continued advances in technology with better image resolution, validation of scoring systems and application at the point of care by gastroenterologists are likely to contribute to increased use of gastrointestinal ultrasound in routine clinical practice.",0
https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bbmt.2020.01.022,Systematic Review of Patient-Reported Outcome Measures in Graft-versus-Host Disease,"<h2>Abstract</h2> Graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) is a major cause of morbidity and mortality after allogeneic stem cell transplantation. These patients face a unique challenge due to the complexity of GVHD and the toxicity of treatments received. GVHD has significant impact on quality of life (QOL), but this is not routinely evaluated formally. Despite the availability of patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs) to assess QOL, there is currently no consensus regarding the optimal PROMs that should be used to evaluate the impact of GVHD. We undertook a systematic review to determine the current evidence for the use of PROMs in assessment of QOL, symptom burden, and disease severity of patients with GVHD. A comprehensive systematic review based on the COSMIN guidelines was conducted to identify studies using PROMs (including those for QOL and symptom burden) in acute and chronic GVHD (cGVHD) patients. The following databases were searched: OVID Medline, AMED, CINAHL, Embase, PROQOLID, ProQuest, PsychINFO, and Social Sciences Citation Index from inception to May 2018. Hand searches updated the search to December 2018. Articles were screened by 2 independent reviewers, with discrepancies resolved by a third independent reviewer. Included articles were critically appraised using the COSMIN Risk of Bias tool, and relevant data on measurement properties for the included PROMs were extracted from within the target population. A total of 4545 articles were identified, and 64 articles reporting on 27 PROMs were included in this review. PROMs were separated into 5 groups; generic patient-reported measures (n = 7), cancer-specific measures (n = 4), bone marrow transplant–specific measures (n = 2), cGVHD-specific measures (n = 4), and dimension-specific measures (n = 10). Three PROMs (Human Activity Profile, Lee Symptom Scale, National Institutes of Health Eleven Point Scale) had evidence to support strong reliability (including internal consistency), responsiveness, and aspects of validity within the cGVHD population. Only 5 included PROMs were used in patients with acute GVHD. This review summarizes the current evidence regarding the use of 27 included PROMs in the context of GVHD. The choice of the most optimal PROM depends on the clinical or research context of use. Future research should comprehensively validate these tools in the GVHD population, including the testing and possible development of a PROM for use in acute GVHD, which remains a current critical gap in the existing literature.",0
https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pmed.1003068,Hepatitis B virus seroepidemiology data for Africa: Modelling intervention strategies based on a systematic review and meta-analysis,"International Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) for elimination of hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection set ambitious targets for 2030. In African populations, infant immunisation has been fundamental to reducing incident infections in children, but overall population prevalence of chronic hepatitis B (CHB) infection remains high. In high-prevalence populations, adult catch-up vaccination has sometimes been deployed, but an alternative Test and Treat (T&T) approach could be used as an intervention to interrupt transmission. Universal T&T has not been previously evaluated as a population intervention for HBV infection, despite high-profile data supporting its success with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV).We set out to investigate the relationship between prevalence of HBV infection and exposure in Africa, undertaking a systematic literature review in November 2019. We identified published seroepidemiology data representing the period 1995-2019 from PubMed and Web of Science, including studies of adults that reported prevalence of both hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg; prevalence of HBV infection) and antibody to hepatitis B core antigen (anti-HBc; prevalence of HBV exposure). We identified 96 studies representing 39 African countries, with a median cohort size of 370 participants and a median participant age of 34 years. Using weighted linear regression analysis, we found a strong relationship between the prevalence of infection (HBsAg) and exposure (anti-HBc) (R2 = 0.45, p < 0.001). Region-specific differences were present, with estimated CHB prevalence in Northern Africa typically 30% to 40% lower (p = 0.007) than in Southern Africa for statistically similar exposure rates, demonstrating the need for intervention strategies to be tailored to individual settings. We applied a previously published mathematical model to investigate the effect of interventions in a high-prevalence setting. The most marked and sustained impact was projected with a T&T strategy, with a predicted reduction of 33% prevalence by 20 years (95% CI 30%-37%) and 62% at 50 years (95% CI 57%-68%), followed by routine neonatal vaccination and prevention of mother to child transmission (PMTCT; at 100% coverage). In contrast, the impact of catch-up vaccination in adults had a negligible and transient effect on population prevalence. The study is constrained by gaps in the published data, such that we could not model the impact of antiviral therapy based on stratification by specific clinical criteria and our model framework does not include explicit age-specific or risk-group assumptions regarding force of transmission.The unique data set collected in this study highlights how regional epidemiology data for HBV can provide insights into patterns of transmission, and it provides an evidence base for future quantitative research into the most effective local interventions. In combination with robust neonatal immunisation programmes, ongoing PMTCT efforts, and the vaccination of high-risk groups, diagnosing and treating HBV infection is likely to be of most impact in driving advances towards elimination targets at a population level.",0

Despite the fact that NAs have a favourable safety profile, undesired adverse events (AEs) may occur during the treatment of CHB. Given the eminent number of patients currently receiving NAs, even a small risk of any of these toxicities can represent a major medical issue. The main objective of this review was to analyse information available on AEs associated with the use of NAs in published studies. We choose the following MesH terms for this systematic review: chronic hepatitis B, side effects and treatment. All articles published from 1 January 1990 up to 19 February 2018 in MEDLINE of PubMed, EMBASE, the Cochrane Library and LILACS databases were searched. A total of 120 articles were selected for analysis, comprising 6419 patients treated with lamivudine (LAM), 5947 with entecavir (ETV), 3566 with tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF), 3096 with telbivudine (LdT), 1178 with adefovir dipivoxil (ADV) and 876 with tenofovir alafenamide (TAF). The most common AEs in all NAs assessed were abdominal pain/discomfort, nasopharyngitis/upper respiratory tract infections, fatigue, and headache. TAF displays the highest density of AEs per patient treated among NAs (1.14 AE/treated patient). In conclusion, treatment of CHB with NAs is safe, with a low incidence of AEs. Despite the general understanding TAF being safer than TDF, the number of patients treated with TAF still is too small in comparison to other NAs to consolidate an accurate safety profile.

Indirect evidence from related conditions must therefore inform inferences regarding benefits and harms. To support a guideline for managing COVID-19, we conducted systematic reviews examining the impact of corticosteroids in COVID-19 and related severe acute respiratory illnesses. <h3>METHODS:</h3> We searched standard international and Chinese biomedical literature databases and prepublication sources for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and observational studies comparing corticosteroids versus no corticosteroids in patients with COVID-19, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) or Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS). For acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), influenza and community-acquired pneumonia (CAP), we updated the most recent rigorous systematic review. We conducted random-effects meta-analyses to pool relative risks and then used baseline risk in patients with COVID-19 to generate absolute effects. <h3>RESULTS:</h3> In ARDS, according to 1 small cohort study in patients with COVID-19 and 7 RCTs in non–COVID-19 populations (risk ratio [RR] 0.72, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.55 to 0.93, mean difference 17.3% fewer; low-quality evidence), corticosteroids may reduce mortality. In patients with severe COVID-19 but without ARDS, direct evidence from 2 observational studies provided very low-quality evidence of an increase in mortality with corticosteroids (hazard ratio [HR] 2.30, 95% CI 1.00 to 5.29, mean difference 11.9% more), as did observational data from influenza studies. Observational data from SARS and MERS studies provided very low-quality evidence of a small or no reduction in mortality. Randomized controlled trials in CAP suggest that corticosteroids may reduce mortality (RR 0.70, 95% CI 0.50 to 0.98, 3.1% lower; very low-quality evidence), and may increase hyperglycemia. <h3>INTERPRETATION:</h3> Corticosteroids may reduce mortality for patients with COVID-19 and ARDS. For patients with severe COVID-19 but without ARDS, evidence regarding benefit from different bodies of evidence is inconsistent and of very low quality.",0

Drivers have an additional risk of hypertension when compared to the general population because of the nature of their profession. Hence, the current review was done to estimate the global burden of hypertension among professional drivers.We conducted a systematic search for articles on the prevalence of hypertension among drivers published from 2000 to 2017 in Medline and Embase. Meta-analysis was performed using the random-effects model and pooled prevalence of hypertension was reported. Heterogeneity was assessed using the likelihood ratio (LR) test and publication bias was assessed using Egger's test.In total, 26 studies with 15,702 drivers were included. The pooled prevalence of hypertension among the drivers worldwide was 34% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 27-40%). World Health Organization (WHO) region-wise estimates showed that prevalence was highest among the drivers in the Western Pacific region (56%) and lowest in the Eastern Mediterranean and African region (21%). Studies showed significant evidence of heterogeneity (χ2 = 1816.1,P < 0.001) but there was no significant publication bias (P = 0.967).More than one-third of drivers have hypertension globally which is in excess of the general population. Hence, more focus needs to be given for allocating resources and developing workplace interventions for prevention and control of hypertension.",0

LNR has recently emerged as a prognostic factor in rectal cancer. The objective of our study was to pool eligible studies to elucidate the prognostic role of LNR on overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS) in rectal cancer patients using a meta-analysis. Methods A systematic database search was performed in MEDLINE and Embase for relevant studies that reported LNR in rectal cancer. Two authors independently screened the relevant articles for selection and data extraction. As a result, a list of such studies and references, published in English up to December 2019, was obtained, and a total of 4,486 node-positive patients in 18 studies were included in this meta-analysis. RevMan software 5.3 (Cochrane Collaboration, the Nordic Cochrane Centre, Copenhagen) was used for conducting all statistical analyses. Results A higher LNR was significantly correlated with worse OS [hazard ratio (HR): 2.60; 95% confidence interval (CI): 2.21-3.06; p≤.00001] and DFS (HR: 2.43; 95% CI: 2.11-2.80; p≤.00001) in node-positive rectal cancer patients. Besides, LNR is an independent predictive and prognostic marker of OS and DFS (HR: 2.52; 95% CI: 2.17-2.94; p≤.00001 with I2=0%; p=.32 and HR: 2.63; 95% CI: 2.17-3.18; p≤.00001 with I2=0%; p=.63 respectively, irrespective of lymph nodal harvest). Conclusions Our present study demonstrates that LNR is an independent predictor of survival in rectal cancer. LNR should be considered as a parameter in future oncological staging systems. Further well-designed randomized control trials to prospectively assess LNR as an independent predictor of rectal cancer survival are necessary before its application in daily practice.",0

Four bibliographic databases were searched; quality and risk of bias assessment were performed using pre-established criteria. <h3>Results</h3> Six articles were included; most were of high quality and low risk of bias. Punctate tactile threshold (<i>n</i> = 70) and mechanical temporal summation (<i>n</i> = 35) were eligible for analysis. Cats with OA have lower punctate tactile threshold [mean difference (95%HDI): −44 (−60; −26) grams] and facilitated temporal summation of pain [hazard ratio (95%HDI): 5.32 (2.19; 14) times] when compared with healthy cats. The effect of sex and body weight on sensory sensitivity remained inconclusive throughout all analyses. Due to the correlation between age and OA status, it remains difficult to assess the effect of OA on sensory sensitivity, independently of age. <h3>Conclusions</h3> Clear and transparent reporting using guidelines are warranted. Similar to people, centralized sensitization is a feature of OA in cats. Future studies should try to elucidate the age effect on feline OA. Research with natural OA in cats is promising with potential to benefit feline health and welfare, and improve translatability to clinical research.",0

We therefore sought to systematically review the literature on the effects of THC on CBF following PRISMA guidelines. Studies assessing the acute and chronic effects of THC on CBF, perfusion and volume were searched in the PubMed database between January 1972 and June 2019. We included thirty-four studies, which altogether investigated 1259 humans and 28 animals. Acute and chronic THC exposure have contrasting and regionally specific effects on CBF. While acute THC causes an overall increase in CBF in the anterior cingulate cortex, frontal cortex and insula, in a dose-dependent manner, chronic cannabis use results in an overall reduction in CBF, especially in the prefrontal cortex, which may be reversed upon prolonged abstinence from the drug. Future studies should focus on standardised methodology and longitudinal assessment to strengthen our understanding of the region-specific effects of THC on CBF and its clinical and functional significance. • Acute and chronic THC exposure have contrasting and regionally specific effects on CBF. • Acute THC dose-dependently increases CBF in anterior cingulate cortex, frontal cortex and insula. • Chronic cannabis is associated with a reduction in CBF which may be reversed following abstinence from the drug. • Further research is needed to elucidate the functional significance of THC-induced changes of CBF.",0

Data extraction and synthesis were conducted between January 2018 and August 2019.Cognitive test scores and demographic variability between exposed and unexposed groups.A total of 16 unique cohorts, described in 27 articles and including 1086 children (485 [44.7%] with MAT exposure), were included in a quantitative synthesis. On meta-analysis, MAT exposure was associated with lower cognitive development scores (pooled standardized mean difference, -0.57; 95% CI, -0.93 to -0.21; I2 = 81%). Multiple subanalyses on demographic characteristics (ie, maternal education, race/ethnicity, socioeconomic status, prenatal tobacco exposure, infant sex) were conducted. In the subanalysis of studies with comparable prenatal exposure to tobacco smoke, the association of MAT exposure with cognitive scores was no longer statistically significant and became homogeneous (standardized mean difference, -0.11; 95% CI, -0.42 to 0.20; I2 = 0%).In this study, predefined subanalyses demonstrated how poor recruitment, particularly imbalances in maternal tobacco use, could contribute to a negative overall association of cognitive development test scores with prenatal MAT exposure. Promoting tobacco cessation for pregnant women with opioid use disorder should be prioritized in this high-risk population.",0
https://doi.org/10.1111/jdv.15964,The association between pesticide use and cutaneous melanoma: a systematic review and meta‐analysis,"Background The incidence of cutaneous melanoma (CM), the deadliest form of skin cancer, has gradually increased in the last decades among populations of European origin. Epidemiological studies suggested that farmers and agricultural workers are at an increased risk of CM because they were exposed to pesticides. However, little is known about the relationship between pesticides and CM. Objectives To investigate the association between exposure to pesticides and CM by systematically reviewing the literature. Secondary aim was to determine the categories of pesticides mainly involved in CM development. Methods A systematic review of the literature was performed up to September 2018 using MEDLINE, Embase and Web of Science. Studies assessing CM risk in licensed pesticide applicators were considered. Strict criteria were established to select independent studies and risk estimates; random effect models, taking into account heterogeneity, were applied. A pooled risk estimate for CM was calculated for the use of each type of pesticide and type of exposure. Between-study and estimate heterogeneity was assessed and publication bias investigated. Results A total of nine studies (two case-controls and seven cohorts) comprising 184 389 unique subjects were included. The summary relative risks for the categories 'herbicides - ever exposure', 'insecticides - ever exposure', 'any pesticide - ever exposure' and 'any pesticide - high exposure' resulted 1.85 [95% confidence interval (CI): 1.01, 3.36], 1.57 (95% CI: 0.58, 4.25), 1.31 (95% CI: 0.85, 2.04) and 2.17 (95% CI: 0.45, 10.36), respectively. Herbicides and insecticides had no between-study heterogeneity (I2 = 0%), while a significant heterogeneity (I2 > 50%) was detected for the high exposure to any pesticide. No indication for publication bias was found. Conclusions Individuals exposed to herbicides are at an increased risk of CM. Future properly designed observational studies are required to confirm this finding.",1

Following PRISMA guidelines, Google search for “allocation of scarce resources” and “crisis standards of care (CSC)” for each state. We analyzed the plans based on the 2009 Institute of Medicine (IOM) report, which provided guidance for establishing CSC for use in disaster situations, as well as the 2014 CHEST consensus statement’s 11 core topic areas. The search yielded 42 state documents, and we excluded 11 that were not CSC plans. Of the 31 included plans, 13 plans were written for an “all hazards” approach, while 18 were pandemic influenza specific. Eighteen had strong ethical grounding. Twenty-one plans had integrated and ongoing community and provider engagement, education, and communication. Twenty-two had assurances regarding legal authority and environment. Sixteen plans had clear indicators, triggers, and lines of responsibility. Finally, 28 had evidence-based clinical processes and operations. Five plans contained all 5 IOM elements: Arizona, Colorado, Minnesota, Nevada, and Vermont. Colorado and Minnesota have all hazards documents and processes for both adult and pediatric populations and could be considered exemplars for other states.",0

We conducted a systematic review of quantitative studies on health and wellbeing impacts of indoor forms of nature (both real and simulated/artificial), for older adults in residential settings. Research Design and Methods Search terms relating to older adults and indoor nature were run in 13 scientific databases (MEDLINE, CINAHL, AgeLine, Environment Complete, AMED, PsychINFO, EMBASE, HMIC, PsychARTICLES, Global Health, Web of Knowledge, Dissertations and Theses Global, and ASSIA). We also pursued grey literature, global clinical trials registries, and a range of supplementary methods. Results Of 6,131 articles screened against eligibility criteria, 26 studies were accepted into the review, and were quality-appraised using the Effective Public Health Practice Project (EPHPP) tool. The participants were 930 adults aged over 60. Nature interventions and health/wellbeing outcomes were heterogeneous, which necessitated a narrative synthesis. The evidence base was generally weak, with 18 of 26 studies having a high risk of bias. However, several higher-quality studies found indoor gardening and horticulture programs were effective for cognition, psychological wellbeing, social outcomes, and life satisfaction. Discussion and Implications There is inconsistent evidence that indoor nature exposures are beneficial for older care residents. We expect that successful interventions were, at least partly, facilitating social interaction, supporting feelings of autonomy/control, and promoting skill development, that is, factors not necessarily associated with nature per se. Higher-quality studies with improved reporting standards are needed to further elucidate these mechanisms.",1

This article quantifies the effects of antenatal BZD exposure on delivery outcomes. Methods Data Sources: Medline, PsycINFO, CINAHL, Embase, and the Cochrane Library were searched till June 30, 2018. Study Selection: English-language cohort studies comparing antenatal BZD exposure to an unexposed group on any delivery outcome were eligible. In all, 23,909 records were screened, 56 studies were assessed, and 14 studies were included. Data Extraction: Two reviewers independently assessed quality and extracted data. Estimates were pooled using random effects meta-analysis. Sub-analyses examined several potential moderators including timing of exposure. Results: There were 9 outcomes with sufficient data for meta-analysis. Antenatal BZD exposure was significantly associated with increased risk of 6 outcomes initially: spontaneous abortion (pooled odds ratio = 1.86; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.43 to 2.42), preterm birth (1.96; 95% CI, 1.25 to 3.08), low birth weight (2.24; 95% CI, 1.41 to 3.88), low Apgar score (2.19; 95% CI, 1.94 to 2.47), Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU) admission (2.61; 95% CI, 1.64 to 4.14), and induced abortion (2.04; 95% CI, 1.23 to 3.40). There was significant heterogeneity between studies for most outcomes without consistent moderators. Birth weight (mean difference [MD]: −151.35 g; 95% CI, −329.73 to 27.03), gestational age (−0.49 weeks; 95% CI, −1.18 to 0.19), and small for gestational age (SGA; 1.42; 95% CI, 1.00 to 2.01) did not show significant associations although after adjusting for publication bias, gestational age, and SGA became significant, totaling 8 significant outcomes. Conclusions: Antenatal BZD exposure appears to be statistically associated with increased risk of several adverse perinatal outcomes. Although confounds cannot be ruled out, NICU admission does appear clinically relevant and consistent with the antidepressant literature.",0
https://doi.org/10.3390/ph13060106,Animal Models of Metabolic Epilepsy and Epilepsy Associated Metabolic Dysfunction: A Systematic Review,"Epilepsy is a serious neurological disorder affecting around 70 million people globally and is characterized by spontaneous recurrent seizures. Recent evidence indicates that dysfunction in metabolic processes can lead to the alteration of neuronal and network excitability, thereby contributing to epileptogenesis. Developing a suitable animal model that can recapitulate all the clinical phenotypes of human metabolic epilepsy (ME) is crucial yet challenging. The specific environment of many symptoms as well as the primary state of the applicable neurobiology, genetics, and lack of valid biomarkers/diagnostic tests are the key factors that hinder the process of developing a suitable animal model. The present systematic review summarizes the current state of available animal models of metabolic dysfunction associated with epileptic disorders. A systematic search was performed by using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) model. A range of electronic databases, including google scholar, Springer, PubMed, ScienceDirect, and Scopus, were scanned between January 2000 and April 2020. Based on the selection criteria, 23 eligible articles were chosen and are discussed in the current review. Critical analysis of the selected literature delineated several available approaches that have been modeled into metabolic epilepsy and pointed out several drawbacks associated with the currently available models. The result describes available models of metabolic dysfunction associated with epileptic disorder, such as mitochondrial respiration deficits, Lafora disease (LD) model-altered glycogen metabolism, causing epilepsy, glucose transporter 1 (GLUT1) deficiency, adiponectin responsive seizures, phospholipid dysfunction, glutaric aciduria, mitochondrial disorders, pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) α-subunit gene (PDHA1), pyridoxine dependent epilepsy (PDE), BCL2-associated agonist of cell death (BAD), Kcna1 knock out (KO), and long noncoding RNAs (lncRNA) cancer susceptibility candidate 2 (lncRNA CASC2). Finally, the review highlights certain focus areas that may increase the possibilities of developing more suitable animal models and underscores the importance of the rationalization of animal models and evaluation methods for studying ME. The review also suggests the pressing need of developing precise robust animal models and evaluation methods for investigating ME.",0

However, few attempts have been made to systematically review the prevalence of hypertension and its risk factor among cotton textile workers in low-and middle-income countries (LMICs). The objective of this study will be to evaluate the prevalence of hypertension and its risk factors among adult cotton textile workers in low- and middle-income countries. Methods We designed and registered a study protocol for a systematic review of descriptive epidemiology data. We will include observational studies (e.g., cross-sectional, cohort, surveys) on the epidemiology of hypertension among adult cotton textile workers in low- and middle-income countries. The primary outcome will be the prevalence of hypertension. Secondary outcomes will be the prevalence of risk factors of hypertension. Literature searches will be conducted in multiple electronic databases (from January 2000 onwards), including PubMed/MEDLINE, CINAHL, Science Direct, and Cochrane Library. Gray literature will be identified through searching conference abstracts, thesis dissertations, and public repositories. Two investigators will independently screen all citations, full-text articles, and abstract data. The study methodological quality (or bias) will be appraised using an appropriate tool. If feasible, we will conduct random effects meta-analysis. Additional analyses will be conducted to explore the potential sources of heterogeneity (e.g., age, gender, years of service, textile department). Discussion This systematic review will identify, evaluate, and integrate evidence on the prevalence and risk factors of hypertension among adult cotton textile workers in low- and middle-income countries. Our findings will be made publicly available in a repository and published in a peer-reviewed journal. Systematic review registration PROSPERO CRD42020167175",0
https://doi.org/10.1159/000507573,Shiftwork and Alcohol Consumption: A Systematic Review of the Literature,"&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Introduction:&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; Shiftwork can be a risk factor for a number of different somatic and psychological health conditions, especially sleep disorders. Shiftworkers sleep less than dayworkers, and 20–40% of them suffer from difficulties initiating and maintaining sleep, which result in reduced capacity for work and social life. A common coping strategy might be the use of alcohol, which presents a health and safety hazard as it further impairs sleep quality and exacerbates sleepiness in the workplace. This review aimed to assess the extent of such possible connections. &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Methods:&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; We performed a systematic search of the scientific literature on shiftwork and alcohol consumption in PubMed, PsycInfo, and Cochrane Library. Only original studies comparing shiftworkers with non-shiftworkers were included. The recommendations of the &lt;i&gt;Preferred Reporting Items of Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses&lt;/i&gt; were followed. &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Results:&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; Fourteen articles are included in this review. Six studies report some kind of connection between shift- or nightwork and alcohol consumption, especially as a sleep aid. Conflicting or negative results are reported by 3 studies. &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Discussion:&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; Shiftwork, especially working at night and in rotation shifts, is associated with binge drinking disorder in different professions. The reasons for pathological consumption of alcohol can be self-medication of sleep problems or coping with stress and psychosocial problems typical for shiftwork. Nurses aged over 50 years represent one important risk group. These results can be important for preventive programs against sleep disorders, including measures other than drinking alcohol as a sleep aid in the workplace of shiftworkers.",0
https://doi.org/10.1089/vbz.2019.2541,Zoonotic Diseases from Horses: A Systematic Review,"Background: Worldwide, horses play critical roles in recreation, food production, transportation, and as working animals. Horses' roles differ by geographical region and the socioeconomic status of the people, but despite modern advances in transportation, which have in some ways altered humans contact with horses, potential risks for equine zoonotic pathogen transmission to humans occur globally. While previous reports have focused upon individual or groups of equine pathogens, to our knowledge, a systematic review of equine zoonoses has never been performed. Methods: Using PRISMA's systematic review guidelines, we searched the English literature and identified 233 previous reports of potential equine zoonoses found in horses. We studied and summarized their findings with a goal of identifying risk factors that favor disease transmission from horses to humans. Results: These previous reports identified 56 zoonotic pathogens that have been found in horses. Of the 233 articles, 13 involved direct transmission to humans (5.6%).The main potential routes of transmission included oral, inhalation, and cutaneous exposures. Pathogens most often manifest in humans through systemic, gastrointestinal, and dermatological signs and symptoms. Furthermore, 16.1% were classified as emerging infectious diseases and thus may be less known to both the equine and human medical community. Sometimes, these infections were severe leading to human and equine death. Conclusions: While case reports of zoonotic infections directly from horses remain low, there is a high potential for underreporting due to lack of knowledge among health professionals. Awareness of these zoonotic pathogens, their disease presentation in horses and humans, and their associated risk factors for cross-species infection are important to public health officials, clinicians, and people with recreational or occupational equid exposure.",0
https://doi.org/10.1111/ijcp.13462,What are physiotherapists and occupational therapists doing in services that replace acute hospital admission? A systematic review,"Alternatives to acute hospital admission are required to accommodate the increasing pressures on health services. Since physiotherapists and occupational therapists are integral to inpatient teams, they may also be integral to admission replacement services, and thus their roles in these services merit investigation.Primarily to determine the presence and roles of physiotherapists and occupational therapists in services replacing acute hospital admission. The secondary outcome is to determine the impact of therapists in such services.Five electronic databases were searched, with keywords related to therapy, discharge, and admission replacement. Inclusion criteria were that studies explicitly described at least one therapist role within a service replacing acute hospital admissions. Two authors independently reviewed all potentially eligible studies. Two reviewers independently assessed data extracted from included studies into a standardized data extraction form.Fifteen studies (3 Hospital at Home, 12 Early Supported Discharge) were included. Both clinical (eg, exercise prescription) and non-clinical (eg, organization and study outcome assessments) therapist roles were described in different admission substitution services. Some roles were only reported among teams, not individually ascribed to therapists.The roles of therapists in services that replace hospital admission are rarely described in detail, with wide variation in reported roles, including across service types and patient populations. This review could not determine the impact of individual therapists on patient or service-level outcomes. Future studies need to more clearly define therapist roles and impact.",0

The MEDLINE/PubMed and Web of Science databases were searched in order to identify epidemiological studies that evaluated the association between occupational MMVF exposure and RTCs. We performed random-effects meta-analyses of relevant studies identified by our literature search, and evaluated sources of between-study heterogeneity. The pooled relative risk (RR) of RTC among workers exposed to MMVFs was 1.09 (95% CI = 0.97, 1.22). The RR was closer to 1.0 when limiting the analysis to effect estimates from studies that accounted for the main a priori risk factors for RTC, asbestos exposure and smoking (RR = 1.03, 95% CI = 0.90, 1.18). Overall, our synthesis of the epidemiological literature suggests that occupational MMVF exposure is not associated with risk of RTC.",1
https://doi.org/10.1055/a-0969-8675,A Systematic Review on the Value of Infrared Thermography in the Early Detection of Periprosthetic Joint Infections,"Abstract Background Variations in the temperature of body and skin are symptoms of many pathological changes. Although joint replacement surgery of hip and knee has been very successful in recent decades, periprosthetic infection is a growing problem and the number one reason for revision. While many studies have investigated changes in blood levels, investigation of temperature has not been performed on a regular basis. The objective of this work is to determine whether reference literature exists for the infrared thermographic examination in knee and hip arthroplasty and if reference values can be derived for the methodology or if there is a peri- and postoperative benefit. Material und Methods By means of a systematic online database search and based on the Cochrane, PICOT and PRISMA guidelines, this systematic review retrieved 254 studies. All publications with thermographic examination in arthroplasty of the hip and knee were imbedded. 249 studies were excluded due to the defined inclusion and exclusion criteria and five studies with 251 patients have finally been included in the evaluation process. This was followed by an analysis and discussion of the methodology. Results and Conclusion Infrared thermography is a useful tool in the perioperative care of patients after arthroplasty of the knee and hip joint. The technology is portable, easy to use and non-invasive. Based only on these few publications, values can be derived, which provide a guidance for the thermographic aftercare in arthroplasty surgery.",0

Methods We carried out a systematic review of qualitative studies using a meta-aggregation approach. Papers published prior to 31 August 2019, were collected from electronic databases, including PubMed/MEDLINE, MEDLINE (Ovid), EMBASE (Ovid), CINAHL (EBSCO), Web of Science, ProQuest Dissertations and Theses, and Cochrane Library (Wiley). Results Six synthesized findings were derived from 14 studies covering cancer patients' awareness of FT, cancer-related expenditures, and the risk factors, impacts, coping strategies, and unmet needs related to FT. Conclusions Cancer survivors incur FT; however, their awareness of FT is limited. Cancer-related FT has multiple impacts on survivors' lives. Although cancer survivors try to cope with FT through adjustments, they still have unmet needs for the management of FT. Nurses and social workers can play a critical role in helping survivors manage FT by increasing pre-awareness of FT, strengthening emotional empowerment, and providing personalized informative support.",0

The consensus of risk equivalence is greatly based on historical evidence, focussing on initial stroke risks. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to describe the impact of AF type on the risk of thromboembolic recurrence, mortality and major haemorrhage in patients with previous stroke. Methods We systematically searched four multidisciplinary databases from inception to December 2018. We selected observational studies investigating clinical outcomes in patients with ischaemic stroke and AF, stratified by AF type. We assessed all included studies for risk of bias using the ‘Risk of Bias In Non-randomised Studies – of Exposures’ tool. The Comprehensive Meta-Analysis Software was used to calculate odds ratios from crude event rates. Results After reviewing 14,127 citations, we selected 108 studies for full-text screening. We extracted data from a total of 26 studies, reporting outcomes on 23,054 patients. Overall, risk of bias was moderate. The annual incidence rates of thromboembolism in patients with non-paroxysmal AF and paroxysmal AF were 7.1% (95% confidence interval: 4.2–11.7) and 5.2% (95% confidence interval: 3.2–8.2), respectively. The odds ratio for thromboembolism in patients with non-paroxysmal AF versus paroxysmal AF was 1.47 (95% confidence interval: 1.08–1.99, p = 0.013). The annual mortality rates in patients with non-paroxysmal AF and paroxysmal AF were 20.0% (95% confidence interval: 13.2–28.0) and 10.1% (95% confidence interval: 5.4–17.3), respectively, and odds ratio was 1.90 (95% confidence interval: 1.43–2.52, p &lt; 0.001). There was no difference in rates of major haemorrhage, odds ratio = 1.01 (95% confidence interval: 0.61–1.69, p = 0.966). Conclusion In patients with prior stroke, non-paroxysmal AF is associated with significantly higher risk of thromboembolic recurrence and mortality than paroxysmal AF. Although current guidelines make no distinction between non-paroxysmal AF and paroxysmal AF for secondary stroke prevention, future guidance and risk stratification tools may need to consider this differential risk (PROSPERO ID: CRD42019118531).",0

Dissociative effects and low cost led ketamine becoming an illegal recreational drug in young adults. Ketamine-induced uropathy (KIU) is one of the complications observed in abusers. This study aimed to provide a systematic literature review on KIU clinical presentation, pathophysiology, and treatments. Methods We performed the literature search in PubMed, Web of Science, Scopus, and Embase using the terms ketamine and bladder. English papers on human and animal studies were accepted. Results A total of 75 papers were selected. Regular ketamine users complain about severe storage symptoms and pelvic pain. Hydronephrosis may develop in long-term abusers and is correlated to the contracted bladder, ureteral stenosis, or vesicoureteral reflux due to ureteral involvement and/or bladder fibrosis. Cystoscopy shows ulcerative cystitis. Ketamine in urine might exert direct toxicity to the urothelium, disrupting its barrier function and enhancing cell apoptosis. The presence of ketamine/ions in the bladder wall result in neurogenic/IgE-mediated inflammation, stimulation of the inducible nitric oxide synthase-cytokines-cyclooxygenase pathway with persistent inflammation and fibrosis. Abstinence is the first therapeutic step. Anti-inflammatory drugs, analgesics and anticholinergics, intravesical instillation of hyaluronic acid, hydrodistension and intravesical injection of botulin toxin-A were helpful in patients with early-stage KIU. In patients with end-stage disease, the control of intractable symptoms and the increase of bladder capacity were the main recommendations to perform augmentation enterocystoplasty. Conclusions KIU is becoming a worldwide health concern, which should be taken into account in the differential diagnosis of ulcerative cystitis.",0
https://doi.org/10.1016/j.prosdent.2019.08.015,Association of oral health–related quality of life and Alzheimer disease: A systematic review,"Oral health-related quality of life (OHRQoL) is a subjective measure that assesses a person's perception of oral health. Patients with Alzheimer disease (AD) suffer from impaired cognitive function and a compromised ability to perform activities of daily living. Further exploration is needed to clarify whether OHRQoL is negatively impacted by cognitive degeneration and oral health conditions among patients with AD.The purpose of this systematic review was to increase understanding of OHRQoL among patients with AD and explore factors that may affect OHRQoL.Searches were conducted in PubMed, the Cochrane Library database, Medline, EBSCO, ProQuest, and EMBASE until August 30, 2018, with no date restrictions. The initial search targeted quantitative observational studies published in English that included the keywords AD, oral, prosthesis, and OHRQoL. Data extraction was independently conducted by 2 reviewers. OHRQoL was investigated as the outcome. Cognitive status and oral health conditions were treated as exposures. Tools used to measure OHRQoL included the Geriatric Oral Health Assessment Index (GOHAI) and the Oral Health Impact Profile. The research adhered to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines.Six studies were included. The sample sizes ranged from 30 to 226 participants, 5 studies used cross-sectional designs, and 1 was a nonrandomized controlled trial. Three studies reported higher OHRQoL scores among participants with AD than those among controls, but only 1 study showed a statistically significant difference. A statistical analysis was conducted with 4 studies that reported GOHAI scores, and no significant differences were found in GOHAI scores between participants with AD and controls (standard mean difference: 0.09; 95% confidence interval: -0.66 to 0.85). All studies that explored factors affecting OHRQoL showed different associations between cognitive impairment, oral health conditions, and OHRQoL. One study showed that cognitive impairment was negatively associated with OHRQoL. Three studies found oral health conditions (including periodontitis, gingival bleeding, probing depth >4 mm, and number of natural teeth) impaired the OHRQoL of participants with AD. Three studies reported that prosthetic type and quality positively affected OHRQoL among participants with AD.OHRQoL may not fully represent actual oral health problems of patients with AD. Clinical dentists should evaluate oral problems in this population, preferably by using both subjective and objective examinations, including oral and dental conditions. This will ensure oral problems among patients with AD can be detected early and timely treatment provided.",0
https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjqs-2019-010822,Prevalence of harmful diagnostic errors in hospitalised adults: a systematic review and meta-analysis,"Background Diagnostic error is commonly defined as a missed, delayed or wrong diagnosis and has been described as among the most important patient safety hazards. Diagnostic errors also account for the largest category of medical malpractice high severity claims and total payouts. Despite a large literature on the incidence of inpatient adverse events, no systematic review has attempted to estimate the prevalence and nature of harmful diagnostic errors in hospitalised patients. Methods A systematic literature search was conducted using Medline, Embase, Web of Science and the Cochrane library from database inception through 9 July 2019. We included all studies of hospitalised adult patients that used physician review of case series of admissions and reported the frequency of diagnostic adverse events. Two reviewers independently screened studies for inclusion, extracted study characteristics and assessed risk of bias. Harmful diagnostic error rates were pooled using random-effects meta-analysis. Results Twenty-two studies including 80 026 patients and 760 harmful diagnostic errors from consecutive or randomly selected cohorts were pooled. The pooled rate was 0.7% (95% CI 0.5% to 1.1%). Of the 136 diagnostic errors that were described in detail, a wide range of diseases were missed, the most common being malignancy (n=15, 11%) and pulmonary embolism (n=13, 9.6%). In the USA, these estimates correspond to approximately 249 900 harmful diagnostic errors yearly. Conclusion Based on physician review, at least 0.7% of adult admissions involve a harmful diagnostic error. A wide range of diseases are missed, including many common diseases. Fourteen diagnoses account for more than half of all diagnostic errors. The finding that a wide range of common diagnoses are missed implies that efforts to improve diagnosis must target the basic processes of diagnosis, including both cognitive and system-related factors.

https://doi.org/10.2106/jbjs.rvw.19.00203,A Majority of Single Versus Double-Row Rotator Cuff Repair Comparisons Fail to Consider Modern Single-Row Techniques,"Background There is considerable published research comparing (SR) and double-row (DR) rotator cuff repairs. Conclusions of primary studies as well as multiple meta-analyses have differed. One underexplored factor has been the variability in techniques that are identified as single-row or double-row. Our goal was to conduct a systematic review of primary research and meta-analyses comparing SR and DR fixation techniques, with attention to the specific technique types compared. Methods We evaluated meta-analyses and individual studies that directly compared SR and DR repairs. Primary studies from 8 high-quality meta-analyses published prior to 2014, and any Level-III or higher studies published from 2014 to 2019, were included. Specific techniques of repair were identified, and the manuscripts were classified on the basis of the specific type of simple or complex SR or DR repair that was performed. Conclusions of the studies were then assessed according to these classifications. Results Twenty-two studies met the eligibility criteria; 9 were Level-I studies, 7 were Level-II, and 6 were Level-III. Of the 22 studies, only 3 (14%) of the studies compared a biomechanically superior complex SR technique and a DR repair. The remaining 19 (86%) of the studies utilized biomechanically inferior, simple SR techniques in their comparisons. Conclusions While there is a large amount of published evidence comparing SR and DR rotator cuff repair techniques, there are few studies assessing how the strongest SR techniques compare with DR techniques. This identifies a deficiency in the current understanding of rotator cuff repair techniques. Future studies specifically designed with these techniques in mind will help to further the understanding of which technique is clinically and financially superior in this continuously changing medical environment.

Considering the potentially severe outcomes of the disease, vaccination is recommended for those at risk of exposure. During recent years, IC51 (IXIARO®, JESPECT®, JEVAL®) has increasingly been used to protect travellers from Europe and the USA. However, no systematic review exists that summarizes the currently available evidence on the immunogenicity and safety of this vaccine. We conducted a systematic review on the immunogenicity and safety of IC51, using the databases PubMed, MEDLINE, EMBASE and ClinicalTrials.gov (search date: 31 August 2019). Data extracted from included studies were grouped by outcomes and stratified by population and setting. Risk of bias (ROB) was assessed using the RoB 2 tool for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and ROBINS-I for non-randomized studies. Due to high heterogeneity, meta-analysis was not performed. A total of 32 studies from 16 countries met the inclusion criteria (15 RCTs, 17 non-randomized studies). ROB was serious or high in the majority of studies. Seroprotection rates ranged from 93 to 100% in adults (seven studies) and from 91 to 100% in children (four studies). In the study involving adults aged 64 years and older, seroprotection was 65% with higher rates in persons who were previously vaccinated against tick-borne encephalitis virus. Safety was investigated in 27 studies. Rates of serious adverse events were below 5% in all age groups, with the majority not being causally related to the vaccine. IC51 is a safe vaccine with good seroprotective abilities in persons aged &amp;gt;2 months to &amp;lt;64 years. The body of evidence, however, is weakened by a large amount of heterogeneity in study and clinical trial methodology. Further well-designed RCTs with special risk groups are needed.",0

This study synthesised the available evidence examining non-pharmacological interventions to prevent hospital or nursing home admissions for community-dwelling older people with dementia. Seven health science databases of all dates were searched up to 2 December 2019. Randomised controlled trials and comparative studies investigating non-pharmacological interventions for older people with dementia who lived in the community were included. Meta-analyses using a random-effect model of randomised controlled trials were used to assess the effectiveness of interventions using measures taken as close to 12 months into follow-up as reported. Outcomes were risk and rate of hospital and nursing home admissions. Risk ratio (RR) or rate ratios (RaR) with 95% confidence interval were used to pool results for hospital and nursing home admission outcomes. Sensitivity analyses were conducted to include pooling of results from non-randomised trails. Twenty studies were included in the review. Community care coordination reduced rate of nursing home admissions [(2 studies, n = 303 people with dementia and 86 patient-caregiver dyads), pooled RaR = 0.66, 95% CI (0.45, 0.97), I2  = 0%, p = .45]. Single interventions of psychoeducation and multifactorial interventions comprising of treatment and assessment clinics indicated no effect on hospital or nursing home admissions. The preliminary evidence of community care coordination on reducing the rate of nursing home admissions may be considered with caution when planning for community services or care for older people living with dementia.",0

Diet changes might influence carcinogenesis and prognosis. We aimed to determine the effects of vitamin D and calcium on colorectal adenoma incidence, malignancy development and prognosis. <h3>Methods</h3> Systematic literature searches (PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane Library databases) and hand searches were performed by September 30, 2019. A random-effects model was adopted to pool relative ratios (RRs) for colorectal tumour incidence or hazard ratios (HRs) for CRC mortality. Stratified analyses were performed by gender, tumour location, calcium intake level and ethnic group. <h3>Results</h3> Total 854,195 cases from 166 studies were included. The colorectal adenoma incidence was inversely correlated with the circulating 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] level (RR: 0.80, 95% CI: 0.71–0.89), vitamin D intake (RR: 0.87, 95% CI: 0.82–0.92) and calcium intake (RR: 0.86, 95% CI: 0.81–0.91). The CRC incidence was decreased by circulating 25(OH)D (RR: 0.67, 95% CI: 0.59–0.77), vitamin D intake (RR: 0.85, 95% CI: 0.78–0.93) and calcium intake (RR: 0.75, 95% CI: 0.70–0.79). High-level circulating 25(OH)D triggered better overall survival (HR: 0.67, 95% CI: 0.57–0.79) and CRC-specific survival (HR: 0.63, 95% CI: 0.53–0.74). Stratified analyses showed that vitamin D and calcium significantly suppressed colorectal tumour incidence among women. Left-sided CRC risk was reversely related to circulating 25(OH)D (RR: 0.60, 95% CI: 0.41–0.88) and vitamin D intake (RR: 0.73, 95% CI: 0.57–0.93). Circulating 25(OH)D decreased colorectal adenoma (RR: 0.63, 95% CI: 0.48–0.82) and CRC (RR: 0.69, 95% CI: 0.56–0.86) risk in populations with higher calcium intake. European and American populations benefited more from vitamin D intake against colorectal tumour. A significant dose–response relationship was observed between intake of vitamin D or calcium and colorectal tumour incidence. <h3>Conclusions</h3> Vitamin D and calcium play additively chemopreventive roles in colorectal adenoma incidence, malignant transformation and progression, especially for women and left-sided CRC patients.",0

The authors evaluated the efficacy of structural body allograft versus polyetheretherketone (PEEK) implants in patients undergoing spinal fusion surgery.A systematic review of electronic databases was conducted using different Medical Subject Headings terms from January 1970 to August 2019. Pooled and subgroup analyses were performed using random-effects and fixed-effects models based on I2 heterogeneity.The analysis included 6640 patients (structural allograft 64% and PEEK cage 36%) from 7 comparative studies. There were no statistically significant differences in age (P = 0.27), sex (P = 0.31), body mass index (P = 0.82), and smoking status (P = 0.27) between the 2 groups. Overall, the mean follow-up was 12.9 ± 1.5 months. Pooled meta-analysis revealed that patients with structural allograft had 2.59-fold higher likelihood of fusion compared with patients with PEEK cages (odds ratio [OR] 2.59, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.02-6.57, P = 0.05) at last follow-up evaluation. Patients with structural allograft had 61% less likelihood of pseudarthrosis (OR 0.39, 95% CI 0.15-0.98, P = 0.05) and 74% lower incidence of reoperation compared with patients with PEEK implants (OR 0.26, 95% CI 0.09-0.79, P = 0.02). Our results suggest that patients with structural allografts had a higher subsidence rate compared with patients with PEEK implants, but this was statistically insignificant (OR 1.07, 95% CI 0.45-2.53, P = 0.89).Our results corroborate that structural allografts are highly effective in promoting bony fusion compared with PEEK implants in patients undergoing spinal fusion surgery.",0

Therefore, this study was aimed to investigate the correlation between the accumulation of PTEs (Fe, Zn, Cr, Ni, Cu, Pb, As, Cd, and Se) in edible parts of spinach and radish plants and sewage irrigation by the aid of a meta-analysis. Moreover, the non-carcinogenic risk (N-CR) and carcinogenic risk (CR) for health risk assessment of consumers were assessed through actual total target hazard quotient (TTHQact) and carcinogenic risk (CRact). After the screening process, 51 articles with 75 studies were included. According to findings, the rank order of PTEs in spinach and radish were Fe > Zn > Cr > Cu > Ni > Pb > Cd > As > Se and Fe > Zn > Cr > Ni > Cu > Pb > As > Cd > Se, respectively. PTE adsorption by edible parts of spinach (leafy vegetable) was higher than radish. The health risk assessment shows that residents in Iran, India, and China are at N-CR while the population of Iran, India, and Pakistan are facing CR.",0
https://doi.org/10.1136/jech-2020-213842,Association between anaemia and adult depression: a systematic review and meta-analysis of observational studies,"Background Several observational studies have been conducted to investigate the link between anaemia and adult depression but have shown inconsistent results. This systematic review and meta-analysis was performed to investigate this association. Methods A comprehensive search of four electronic databases (PubMed, EMBASE, PsycINFO and the Cochrane Library) was conducted to identify relevant papers published up to November 2019 for the systematic review and meta-analysis. The Newcastle-Ottawa Scale was used to assess the methodological quality of selected studies. A random-effects model was used to draw metaestimates of the relationship between anaemia and adult depression. Results A total of 9706 papers were retrieved, and 14 observational epidemiological studies (9 case–control studies and 5 prospective cohort studies) comprising 10 764 cases of depression were finally included in this meta-analysis. The mean age of the participants ranged from 38.4 to 75.0 years. A significant association was identified between low haemoglobin levels and adult depression (OR or relative risk 1.43; 95% CI 1.23 to 1.65). Subgroup analyses according to study design, mean age, diagnostic criteria of anaemia, geographical region, number of participants, methodological quality and adjustment for various confounding factors such as education, smoking, comorbid disorders, physical activity, alcohol intake and medication use showed similar results. Conclusions The current study showed that anaemia was related to an increased risk of adult depression. One of the important limitations of our study was a moderate degree of heterogeneity due to the variety of assessment tools used to identify depression and the existence of publication bias. Another limitation of this meta-analysis was the lack of prospective cohort studies.",0

Constant exposure to cosmic radiation and circadian disruption are postulated to be the culprits of the problem. A systematic review was performed by 2 independent reviewers with predefined search strategy, in line with the PRISMA protocol. A total of 43 studies were identified using the preset keywords defined in the study protocol. After excluding irrelevant papers, 12 studies were included for pooled analysis. Ten studies evaluated the breast cancer prevalence in flight attendants, whereas 3 studies evaluated the breast cancer-related deaths. Pooled analysis found that, of the 45,111 flight attendants censored, 1061 (2.35%) had breast cancer. The standardized prevalence ratios were 1.08 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.37-1.59) and 1.09 (95% Cl, 0.37-1.60), respectively, when compared with the American and European general population. Pooled analysis of the 3 studies on breast cancer mortality found that, of the 44,508 flight attendants censored, 139 (0.32%) had breast cancer-related mortality. Standardized mortality ratios to the American/European general population were 1.8 (95% CI, 0.63-4.25) and 1.3 (95% CI, 0.47-3.15), respectively. A review of the available literature indicates that there is insufficient evidence to suggest an association between cosmic irradiation, circadian disruption, and breast cancer in flight attendants. Breast cancer prevalence and mortality among flight attendants are comparable with that of the general population.",0
https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-020-64594-0,Roles of PI3K pan-inhibitors and PI3K-δ inhibitors in allergic lung inflammation: a systematic review and meta-analysis,"Abstract Meta-analysis can be applied to study the effectiveness of the summary estimates for experimental papers, producing objective and unbiased results. We investigated the effects of phosphoinositide-3-kinase (PI3K) on the inflammatory profile in allergic mouse models, which are currently under development in signal transduction materials. PubMed, EMBASE and Web of Science databases were searched for relevant literature using the search terms “ PI3K inhibitor” and “allergy” or “asthma”. Cochrane Review Manager and R were used for handling continuous variables. The primary outcomes of the inflammatory profile were divided into cell counts and inflammatory cytokines. We used a random effects model to draw a forest plot. Through the database search and subsequent selection, 17 articles were identified. Regarding the cell counts, both the PI3K pan-inhibitors and PI3K-δ inhibitors effectively reduced the total cell counts, eosinophils, neutrophils and lymphocytes. In contrast to PI3K-δ inhibitors, PI3K pan-inhibitors effectively reduced macrophages. Regarding the inflammatory cytokines, PI3K pan-inhibitors and PI3K-δ inhibitors effectively reduced total IgE, IL-4, IL-5, IL-13, TNF-α, IL-1β, VEGF and had no effect on IL-6. Compared to the PI3K pan-inhibitors, which block all pathways, selective PI3K-δ inhibitors are expected to be relatively less toxic. Regarding the efficacy, PI3K-δ inhibitors have at least the same or better efficacy than PI3K pan-inhibitors in effector cells and inflammatory mediators.",0
https://doi.org/10.1186/s12955-020-01352-w,Informing the measurement of wellbeing among young people living with HIV in sub-Saharan Africa for policy evaluations: a mixed-methods systematic review,"Abstract Young people living with HIV (YPLHIV) in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) are at high risk of having a poor quality of life. Addressing wellbeing explicitly within HIV/AIDS policies could assist mitigation efforts. However, guidance on wellbeing measures to evaluate policies for YPLHIV is scarce. The aims of this mixed-methods review were to identify: i) key dimensions of wellbeing and ii) wellbeing measures that align to these dimensions among YPLHIV (15–24 years) in SSA. We searched six social science and medical databases, including grey literature. We included studies that examined correlates and lived experiences of wellbeing, among YPLHIV in SSA, from January 2000 to May 2019. Two reviewers independently screened abstracts and full texts and assessed methodological quality of included articles. We analysed quantitative and qualitative data using descriptive and meta-ethnographic approaches, respectively. Thereafter, we integrated findings using a framework approach. We identified 6527 citations. Of these, 10 quantitative and 30 qualitative studies were included. Being male, higher educational status, less stigma and more social support were likely correlates of wellbeing. Themes that shaped experiences suggestive of wellbeing were: 1) acceptance and belonging— stigma, social support; 2) coping; 3) standard of living. Our final synthesis found that the following dimensions potentially characterise wellbeing: self-acceptance, belonging, autonomy; positive relations, environmental mastery, purpose in life. Wellbeing for YPLHIV is multi-dimensional and relational. Relevant measures include the Personal Wellbeing Index, Ryff’s Psychological Wellbeing Scale and Mental Health Continuum Short Form. However, psychometric evaluations of these scales among YPLHIV in SSA are needed.",0
https://doi.org/10.1093/ntr/ntz046,Beliefs and Self-reported Practices of Health Care Professionals Regarding Electronic Nicotine Delivery Systems: A Mixed-Methods Systematic Review and Synthesis,"Abstract Aims This review explores the (1) beliefs and attitudes of health care professionals (HCPs) toward electronic nicotine delivery systems (ENDS) including use as a smoking cessation aid and/or harm reduction, safety and regulation, and (2) the extent and content of patient–HCP communication about ENDS. Methods PubMed, Embase, CINAHL, and PsycINFO were searched to identify articles published since 2003. The Mixed Methods Appraisal Tool and Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology checklists were used to assess the quality of studies. Thematic synthesis was used to analyze qualitative data. Results A total of 45 articles (32 quantitative, 12 qualitative, and 1 mixed) were included. There was wide variation regarding beliefs about the efficacy of ENDS as a cessation aid. Although the majority of HCPs believes that ENDS are safer than combustible cigarettes, they also have concern about the short and long-term safety of ENDS, uptake by adolescents, and the potential for ENDS to act as a “gateway” to smoking cigarettes. Beliefs about ENDS are influenced by media stories and experiences provided by patients. Although most HCPs do not proactively recommend ENDS, they are more likely to support ENDS use among patients with smoking related comorbidities, heavy smokers with previous unsuccessful quit attempts, or patients who express interest in trying them. Conclusions Overall, HCPs hold diverse views about the efficacy of ENDS and expressed wariness over their potential health effects. HCP endorsement of ENDS use seems to depend largely on patient health status, the presence of other competing risk factors and patient preferences. Implication Although evidence on safety and efficacy of ENDS is emerging, HCPs should be honest with their clients, stating that the long-term safety is not yet established but what is known is that they appear to be a lower risk alternative to cigarettes. Our review highlights a need for further training and support for HCPs regarding ENDS use, which would enable them to guide their clients in making evidence-based decisions.",0
https://doi.org/10.1093/jnci/djz211,A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis of Bevacizumab in First-Line Metastatic Breast Cancer: Lessons for Research and Regulatory Enterprises,"Abstract Background The US Food and Drug Administration’s accelerated approval and later withdrawal of bevacizumab in patients with metastatic breast cancer (mBC) is a seminal case for ongoing debates about the validity of using progression-free survival (PFS) as a surrogate measure for overall survival (OS) in cancer drug approvals. We systematically reviewed and meta-analyzed the evidence around bevacizumab’s regulatory approval and withdrawal in mBC. Methods We searched for all published phase II or III clinical trials testing bevacizumab as a first-line therapy for patients with mBC. Data were extracted on trial demographics, interventions, and outcomes. Descriptive analysis was stratified by whether the trial was initiated before, during, or after the accelerated approval. We used a cumulative random-effects meta-analysis to assess the evolution of evidence of the effect of bevacizumab on PFS and OS. We estimated the association between the trial-level PFS and OS effect using a nonlinear mixed-regression model. Results Fifty-two studies were included. Trial activity dramatically dropped after the accelerated approval was withdrawn. Eight clinical trials reported hazard ratios (hazard ratios) and were meta-analyzed. The cumulative hazard ratio for PFS was 0.72 (95% CI = 0.65 to 0.79), and the cumulative hazard ratio for OS was 0.90 (95% CI = 0.80 to 1.01). The regression model showed a statistically nonsignificant association between PFS benefit and OS benefit (β = 0.43, SE = 0.81). Conclusion The US Food and Drug Administration’s decision-making in this case was consistent with the evolving state of evidence. However, the fact that seven clinical trials are insufficient to conclude validity (or lack thereof) for a trial-level surrogate suggests that it would be more efficient to conduct trials using the more clinically meaningful endpoints.",0
https://doi.org/10.1002/ieam.4271,Systematic Review and Weight of Evidence Are Integral to Ecological and Human Health Assessments: They Need an Integrated Framework,"Scientific assessments synthesize the various results of scientific research for policy and decision making. Synthesizing evidence in environmental assessments can involve either or both of 2 systems: systematic review (SR) and weight of evidence (WoE). Systematic review was developed to systematically assemble results of clinical trials to be combined by meta-analysis. Weight-of-evidence approaches have evolved from jurisprudence to make inferences from diverse bodies of evidence in various fields. Our objectives are to describe the similarities and differences between SR and WoE and to suggest how their best practices can be combined into a general framework that is applicable to human health and ecological assessments. Integrating SR and WoE is based on the recognition that 2 processes are required, assembling evidence and making an inference. Systematic review is characterized by methodical literature searching, screening, and data extraction, originally for meta-analysis but now for various inferential methods. Weight of evidence is characterized by systematically relating heterogeneous evidence to considerations appropriate to the inference and making the inference by weighing the evidence. Systematic review enables the unbiased assembly of evidence from literature, but methods for assembling other information must be considered as well. If only 1 type of quantitative study estimates the assessment endpoint, meta-analysis is appropriate for inference. Otherwise, the heterogeneous evidence must be weighed. A framework is presented that integrates best practices into a methodical assembly and weighing of evidence. A glossary of terms for the combined practice and a history of the origins of SR and WoE are provided in Supplemental Data. Integr Environ Assess Manag 2020;16:718-728. Published 2020.

Limited data exists defining expected pain levels and appropriate opioid requirements after rhinologic surgery.A systematic review was performed in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. PubMed, Embase, Ovid MEDLINE, Cochrane Library databases were queried, and relevant articles were identified.A total of 405 articles were identified, of which 13 met final inclusion criteria. Significant heterogeneity existed regarding type and quantity of opioid medication prescribed. Eight studies utilized a subjective patient-reported pain score as an outcome measure and reported mild to moderate postoperative pain that diminished over the first 3-6 days. Eight studies reported over-prescription of opioid medications with inappropriate storage of excess pills at home. Several factors were associated with an increased opioid requirement, including concurrent septoplasty, younger age, and current smoking status.Rhinologic surgery is well tolerated with mild to moderate, short-lived postoperative pain. A limited amount and duration of opioid medications is required for routine management. Patients are frequently prescribed more opioids than is necessary for expected pain level, resulting in the potential for opioid misuse, abuse, and diversion. Current evidence is limited by a predominance of level 4 studies. Larger, higher quality studies with standardized reporting of pain score and opioid prescription quantity are needed.",0

A therapeutic goal of such settings is to provide meaningful engagement and a sense of community that is crucial for the overall quality of life. In recent years, several studies followed this notion by investigating residents’ social interactions and the influence of the environment on these interactions. Aims This review aims to synthesize the literature on the social interactions of persons with dementia living in special care units. Design A mixed-methods systematic review was conducted. Methods Literature was searched in PubMed, CINAHL, PsycINFO, the Cochrane Library and Web of Science databases. Additionally, reference lists of relevant articles were searched. Studies were screened, data were extracted and the quality was appraised. Separate syntheses were conducted for qualitative and quantitative studies, which were subsequently merged in the final mixed-methods synthesis. Results In total, 18 articles were included, investigating large-scale, small-scale and homelike special care units and green care farms. Residents in special care units experience few social interactions but more than those in the comparative groups. Opportunities to interact are only marginally seized. Interactions typically occur in small groups and are facilitated by familiarity and the organizational environment. Residents mainly rely on staff members to create social interaction, for example initiating or facilitating resident-to-resident interaction. Conclusion Although the evidence base is increasing, it is still fragmented and built on different concepts, interventions, control groups and measurements. Nevertheless, the first conclusions suggest a positive impact of special care units on residents’ social interactions. Although the review yielded a more comprehensive picture of residents’ social life, further high-quality research built on a sound theoretical background is needed.",0

The search electronic databases included Medline, EMBASE, Scopus, and Web of Science. All studies reporting football-related or rugby-related genitourinary injuries were included. <h3>Results</h3> Twenty-two records (11 research studies, 11 case reports) were identified. In the pediatric population, the reported football-related kidney injuries were 0.1–0.7% of all football-related injuries, 0.07–0.5% of all sports-related injuries, and 1.5–37.5% of all sports-related genitourinary injuries, with incidence ranging from 0.00000084 to 0.0000092 injuries per exposure (five studies). Pediatric football-related testicular injuries were reported to be 0.11% of all football injuries, 0–0.07% of all sports-related injuries, and 0–37.5% of all sports-related genitourinary injuries; injury per exposure was 0.0000092 (four studies). In adults, there was no proportion of genitourinary injuries that could be determined, and football-related kidney injury incidence was 0.000012 injuries per exposure (one study). No adult literature investigated testicular injuries. Eleven case reports were additionally identified. Review of the case reports suggests that patients with previously existing urologic abnormalities such as ureteropelvic junction obstruction may predispose an individual to kidney injuries. <h3>Conclusion</h3> There is little to suggest that those engaged in football or rugby have a significant risk of genitourinary injury; therefore, future guidelines should reflect this.",0

QUADAS-2 was used to assess the risk of bias. Pooled sensitivity and specificity forest plots were calculated, summary receiver operator characteristics (SROC) curves were constructed. The certainty of the evidence was rated using the GRADE system.Pubmed, Cochrane Library, Web of Science, Scopus, Lilacs/BBO and grey literature databases were surveyed.From 1594 retrieved articles, 13 studies were included. Six studies had a low risk of bias and a low level of concern regarding applicability. Four studies had an unclear risk of bias, while three presented a high risk of bias. The meta-analysis of six studies demonstrated that NILT presented good overall accuracy. Of 6110 teeth, 92.3 % (5639) were accurately classified (776 as true positive and 4863 as true negative). The pooled sensitivity was 0.97 (0.96 to 0.98; p = 0.0000; I2 = 93.2 %) with moderate certainty of evidence, and the pooled specificity was 0.91 (0.91 to 0.92; p = 0.0000; I2 = 98.3 %) with high certainty of evidence. Symmetric (0.9837) and asymmetric (0.9836) SROC showed a high discrimination and determination effect of NILT.The current literature, with moderate certainty and a middling quality of evidence, demonstrates that NILT presents a reasonably comparable accuracy to that of BW for detecting interproximal carious lesions in the permanent dentition.Since NILT presented good overall accuracy for the detection of interproximal primary caries, it could be routinely used in dental check-ups, especially in high-risk caries populations and in patients where the use of radiation should be reduced, like pregnant women or children.",0
https://doi.org/10.1136/ijgc-2020-001199,External beam radiotherapy versus vaginal brachytherapy in patients with stage II endometrial cancer: a systematic review and meta-analysis,"Objective The choice of adjuvant treatment for women with stage II endometrial cancer is challenging, given the known increase in morbidity with external beam radiation compared with vaginal brachytherapy, and the lack of consensus on its benefits. We summarized the evidence on survival and recurrence for stage II endometrial cancer, defined as cervical stromal invasion, after adjuvant postoperative external beam radiotherapy and vaginal brachytherapy. Methods We searched the MEDLINE, EMBASE, CENTRAL, and Scopus databases from inception to January 2019 to identify studies that compared adjuvant postoperative external beam radiotherapy with or without vaginal brachytherapy and vaginal brachytherapy alone in stage II endometrial cancer. Our primary outcome was the locoregional recurrence rate, defined as recurrence in the pelvis or vagina. Secondary outcomes included the rate of recurrence at any site, distant recurrence rate, vaginal recurrence rate, pelvic recurrence rate, and 5 year overall survival. Study selection, assessment, and data abstraction were performed by an independent set of reviewers. Random effects models were used to synthesize quantitative data. Results We included 15 cohort studies reporting data on 1070 women. Most women with stage II endometrial cancer (848/1070, 79.3%) were treated with external beam radiotherapy with or without vaginal brachytherapy. Subgroup analysis was stratified by whether &gt;90% of the women included underwent pelvic lymph node assessment (sampling or full dissection). Locoregional recurrence (pelvic and vaginal recurrence) was significantly reduced with external beam radiotherapy with or without vaginal brachytherapy compared with vaginal brachytherapy alone (14 studies (n=1057); odds ratio (OR) 0.33 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.16 to 0.68); I 2 =5%) regardless of pelvic lymph node assessment. Most women (81.8%) who recurred locoregionally had a least one uterine risk factor (grade 3 tumor, myometrial invasion &gt;50%, or lymphovascular invasion). There was no difference in overall survival with external beam radiotherapy with or without vaginal brachytherapy compared with vaginal brachytherapy alone (five studies (n=463); OR 0.78 (95% CI 0.34 to 1.80); I 2 =48%). Conclusions External beam radiotherapy with or without vaginal brachytherapy decreased the locoregional recurrence threefold for stage II endometrial cancer, regardless of pelvic lymph node assessment. Most women who suffered recurrence locoregionally had a least one high risk factor. Vaginal brachytherapy alone may be sufficient therapy for node negative stage II endometrial cancer without uterine risk factors, while those with uterine risk factors should be considered for external beam radiotherapy with or without vaginal brachytherapy to improve locoregional control.",0

However, a definite conclusion on the clinical value of lncRNA SNHG6 expression in human cancers has not been determined. The purpose of the present meta-analysis was to comprehensively elucidate the association between SNHG6 expression and clinical outcomes in cancers. Methods A systematic search was performed through the PubMed, Web of Science, Chinese National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), and Wangfang databases for relevant studies. The pooled hazard ratios (HRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were collected to estimate the prognostic value, and the odds ratios (ORs) with 95% CIs were used to evaluate the relationship between lncRNA SNHG6 expression and clinicopathological features, including tumor invasion depth, lymph node metastasis (LNM), distance metastasis (DM), and TNM stage. Results In total, 914 patients from 13 studies were included in this meta-analysis. The pooled results suggested that evaluated SNHG6 expression could predict an unfavorable overall survival (OS) (HR = 2.04, 95% CI:1.56–2.52) with no heterogeneity (I 2 = 0.0%, p = 0.996). Subgroup analysis indicated a significant association between high SNHG6 expression and shorter OS in those studies with digestive system cancers (HR = 2.05, 95% CI: 1.47–2.62), or with sample size &lt; 70 (HR = 2.70, 95% CI: 1.29–4.11), or with multivariate analysis (HR = 2.04, 95% CI: 1.44–2.64). Moreover, elevated SNHG6 expression was positively associated with tumor invasion depth (OR = 1.76, 95% CI: 1.18–2.63), LNM (OR = 1.60, 95% CI: 1.18–2.17), DM (OR = 1.90, 95% CI: 1.37–2.64) and advanced TNM stage (OR = 1.88, 95% CI: 1.36–2.60) in patients with cancers. Conclusions High lncRNA SNHG6 expression was correlated with tumor invasion depth, LNM, DM, and advanced TNM stage, suggesting that SNHG6 may serve as a promising prognostic biomarker of human cancers.",0
https://doi.org/10.1111/scs.12743,Digital collaborative learning in nursing education: a systematic review,"Objectives The aim of this systematic review was to evaluate the effectiveness of educational interventions in digital collaborative learning implemented in nursing education. Design A systematic literature review of randomised controlled trials (RCTs) was carried out in accordance with Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) and Centre for Reviews and Dissemination guidelines and the PRISMA statement. Data sources CINAHL (EBSCO), ERIC, MEDLINE (Ovid) and Scopus databases were used to identify original peer-reviewed RCT studies published between 2003 and 2018. Review method The ‘hits’ were systematically screened by title, abstract and full text by two authors acting independently. The quality of the selected original studies was evaluated using the quality assessment criteria of the JBI and Cochrane collaboration's tool for assessing risk of bias in randomised trials. The studies were analysed by narrative synthesis. Results Five peer-reviewed RCT studies were included in the review. All participants in these studies (647 in total) were nursing students exposed to educational interventions in various nursing programme courses. The reviewed studies indicated that digital collaborative learning increased students’ knowledge and nursing skills. The results show that collaborative learning in digital learning environments enhanced nursing students’ interaction and collaborative skills, problem-solving skills, satisfaction and motivation for learning. Conclusion Collaborative learning in digital learning environments has encouraging effects in enhancing nursing students’ knowledge, competence, satisfaction and problem-solving skills. Moreover, evidence-based digital collaborative learning is becoming increasingly effective in nursing education, as available tools and teachers’ abilities to use them are improving and providing new learning activities to boost students’ learning outcomes in higher education. Thus, its systematic use in digital collaborative learning environments in various nursing courses is recommended.",0
https://doi.org/10.3390/jcm9040914,The Effect of Exercise Training on Brain Structure and Function in Older Adults: A Systematic Review Based on Evidence from Randomized Control Trials,"Accumulating evidence suggests that exercise training is associated with improvements in brain health in older adults, yet the extant literature is insufficient in detailing why exercise training facilitates brain structure and function. Specifically, few studies have employed the FITT-VP principle (i.e., Frequency, Intensity, Time, Type, Volume, and Progression) to characterize the exercise exposure, thus research is yet to specify which characteristics of exercise training benefit brain outcomes. To determine whether exercise training is consequential to cognitive and brain outcomes, we conducted a systematic review investigating the effects of exercise training on brain structure and function in older adults. PubMed and Scopus were searched from inception to February 2020, and study quality was assessed using the Cochrane risk-of-bias tool. A total of 24 randomized controlled trials were included. This systematic review indicates that older adults involved in exercise training may derive general benefits to brain health, as reflected by intervention-induced changes in brain structure and function. However, such benefits are dependent upon the dose of the exercise intervention. Importantly, current evidence remains limited for applied exercise prescriptions (e.g., volume, progression) and future research is needed to clarify the effects of exercise training on cognitive and brain outcomes in older adults.",0

Study Design PubMed, Scopus, Medline, and Google Scholar were searched, and only manuscripts clearly reporting pregnancy/fetal outcomes involving tapering or detoxification from opioid drugs were included. Only pregnancies managed after 1980 were included (when antenatal fetal surveillance became more routine). Collected data included study design, location, years patients were managed, number of patients who were tapered or detoxified, method of tapering, and pregnancy outcome. Results A total of 14 publications met the criteria for review after evaluating more than 2,000 abstracts and 153 published manuscripts. In 1,097 pregnancies, based on mortality rate analyses and forest plots, no increased fetal risks due to tapering or detoxification from opioid drugs were identified. No increased risk of preterm delivery was found. Conclusion Pregnant women with opioid use disorder who are stable in a medication-assisted treatment program with behavioral health can be informed that tapering or full detoxification from opioid drugs does not increase the fetal risk of poor pregnancy outcome. Future research needs to answer the questions on maternal and long-term newborn consequences of tapering or detoxification versus long-term newborn consequences of continued chronic in utero opioid exposure.",0

The purpose of this review is to report the state of the science of self-management for individuals with spina bifida (SB) from a lifespan perspective.This review will summarize the (a) development and use of self-management skills and behaviors across the life span, (b) factors related to self-management behaviors, (c) development of generic or condition-specific measures of self-management used with a spina bifida population, and (d) development and/or outcomes of interventions to improve self-management in SB.The search strategy was limited to primary research articles published between 2003 and 2019 and followed PRISMA guidelines. The databases searched included: PubMed, CINAHL, PsycINFO, Web of Science, Cochrane, and Google Scholar. Studies that addressed self-management concepts in individuals throughout the life span and published in English were included.The search yielded 108 citations and 56 articles met inclusion/exclusion criteria. A systematic narrative synthesis was reported. The level of evidence identified was primarily Level III articles of good quality. Multiple demographic, environmental, condition and process factors were related to self-management behaviors. SB self-management instruments and intervention development and testing studies were identified.This review provides a synthesis of the state of the science of self-management including factors related to self-management behaviors, preliminary evidence of instruments for use in SB, factors important to consider in the development and testing of future interventions, and gaps in the literature.",0
https://doi.org/10.1016/j.envres.2020.109346,Environmental exposures and breast cancer risk in the context of underlying susceptibility: A systematic review of the epidemiological literature,"The evidence evaluating environmental chemical exposures (ECE) and breast cancer (BC) risk is heterogeneous which may stem in part as few studies measure ECE during key BC windows of susceptibility (WOS). Another possibility may be that most BC studies are skewed towards individuals at average risk, which may limit the ability to detect signals from ECE.We reviewed the literature on ECE and BC focusing on three types of studies or subgroup analyses based on higher absolute BC risk: BC family history (Type 1); early onset BC (Type 2); and/or genetic susceptibility (Type 3).We systematically searched the PubMed database to identify epidemiologic studies examining ECE and BC risk published through June 1, 2019.We identified 100 publications in 56 unique epidemiologic studies. Of these 56 studies, only 2 (3.6%) were enriched with BC family history and only 11% of studies (6/56) were specifically enriched with early onset cases. 80% of the publications from these 8 enriched studies (Type 1: 8/10 publications; Type 2: 8/10 publications) supported a statistically significant association between ECE and BC risk including studies of PAH, indoor cooking, NO2, DDT; PCBs, PFOSA; metals; personal care products; and occupational exposure to industrial dyes. 74% of Type 3 publications (20/27) supported statistically significant associations for PAHs, traffic-related air pollution, PCBs, phthalates, and PFOSAs in subgroups of women with greater genetic susceptibility due to variants in carcinogen metabolism, DNA repair, oxidative stress, cellular apoptosis and tumor suppressor genes.Studies enriched for women at higher BC risk through family history, younger age of onset and/or genetic susceptibility consistently support an association between an ECE and BC risk. In addition to measuring exposures during WOS, designing studies that are enriched with women at higher absolute risk are necessary to robustly measure the role of ECE on BC risk.",1
https://doi.org/10.1016/j.chest.2019.12.042,The Evolving Landscape of e-Cigarettes,"Smoking continues to be a burden to economies and health-care systems across the world. One proposed solution to the problem has been e-cigarettes; however, because they are a relatively new product in the market, little is known about their potential health impacts. Furthermore, e-cigarettes continue to evolve at a rapid rate, making it necessary to regularly review and summarize available studies. Although e-cigarettes are marketed as a smoking cessation tool by some manufacturers, the reality is that many nonsmokers, including youth, are using them. This review focuses on two major demographic groups (smokers and nonsmokers) and evaluates the most recent data (early 2017 to mid 2019) regarding the potential health effects of e-cigarettes. We assessed peer-reviewed studies on the health impacts of e-cigarettes, with a particular focus on common questions asked by policy makers, clinicians, and scientists: (1) What are the effects of e-cigarettes compared with air/not smoking?; (2) Is there any direct evidence of harm or benefit to humans?; (3) Is there a risk from secondhand exposure?; (4) What are the risks and/or benefits of e-cigarettes compared with tobacco cigarette use?; (5) Are there risks or benefits to specific populations (eg, people with COPD or asthma, pregnant women [and their offspring])?; (6) What are the effects of flavoring chemicals?; (7) What are the effects of including nicotine in e-liquids?; (8) How often is nicotine concentration labeling incorrect?; and (9) What are the risks when e-cigarettes explode?",0

We aimed to conduct the systematic review and meta-analysis to summarize the epidemiological data on prevalence of Cryptococcus species complexes in trees and their surroundings, bird guano and secretions, animals, and highlight the reported episodes of cryptococcosis in Iran.Twelve databases, including PubMed, Science Direct, Scopus, Proquest, Google Scholar, Embase, and the ISI Web of Science, as well as the national databases, from January 1969 to October 2019 were searched. Furthermore, gray literature (e.g., thesis, congress abstracts) was evaluated using Iran Doc and www.thesis.ac.ir. Search process was accomplished on English or Persian language articles using the following keywords: ""Cryptococcus"", ""Cryptococcosis"", ""invasive fungal infection"", ""Humans"", ""Birds"", ""Pigeon"", ""Animals"", ""Tree"", ""Eucalyptus"", and ""Iran"", both alone and in combination.Overall 36 studies were eligible regarding Cryptococcus and cryptococcosis in Iran. The total prevalence rates of Cryptococcus species in the tree was 4.7% (95% CI: 2.3-7.8), and in bird guano was 20.4% (95% CI: 10.7-32.2). Cryptococcosis in animal, and human were 1.7% (95% CI: 0.01-5.1), and 2.8% (95% CI: 0.7v6.1), respectively. The highest prevalence of Cryptococcus in the trees (14.6%), and bird guano (89.4%) in Khorasan, animals (8.9%) in Chaharmahal and Bakhtiari, and human (4.4%) in Mazandaran provinces were reported.Given the significant risk of Cryptococcus species for susceptible humans, mainly HIV-infected patients, it seems quite necessary to adopt concrete preventive strategies to pinpoint the environmental habitats of this yeast.",0
https://doi.org/10.1111/jgh.14928,"Infection, antibiotic exposure, and risk of celiac disease: A systematic review and meta‐analysis","There is evidence of a relationship between infection (and the associated antibiotic exposure) and the risk of celiac disease (CD). This study performed a meta-analysis to investigate this relationship.To identify relevant studies, we conducted systematic searches of the PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane databases for articles published up to April 2019. Random effects models were used to determine overall pooled estimates and 95% confidence intervals (CIs).The meta-analysis included 19 observational studies (15 on infection and six on antibiotic exposure). Our results showed that any infection was associated with an increased risk of CD later in life (odds ratio, 1.37; 95% CI: 1.2-1.56; P < 0.001). The I2 was 94% (high heterogeneity among studies). Subgroup analyses suggested that the risk of CD is not affected by the type of infectious agent, timing of exposure, and site of infection. Exposure to antibiotics was also associated with new-onset CD (odds ratio, 1.2; 95% CI: 1.04-1.39; P < 0.001).Exposure to early infection or antibiotic appears to increase the odds of developing CD, suggesting that intestinal immune or microbiota dysbiosis may play a role in the pathogenesis of CD. These findings may influence clinical management and primary prevention of CD. However, noncausal explanations for these positive associations cannot be excluded.",0

The outcome of Overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS) were extracted and converted to hazard ratios (HRs) with 95% confidence intervals (95%CIs).A total of 40 studies (10 RCTs and 30 non-RCTs) involving 11,165 patients were included. Overall, PA-TACE was associated with an increased OS [HR, 0.71 (95% CI, 0.65-0.77); P < 0.001] and DFS [HR, 0.73 (95% CI, 0.66-0.80); P < 0.001]. Subgroup analysis in patients with microvascular invasion (MVI), tumor diameter >5 cm or multinodular tumors demonstrated that PA-TACE improved OS and DFS. In patients without MVI, PA-TACE showed no improvement in OS [HR, 1.14 (95% CI, 0.85-1.53); P = 0.370], and resulted in worse DFS than curative resection alone [HR, 1.20 (95% CI, 1.03-1.39); P = 0.002].This meta-analysis indicated that PA-TACE was beneficial in patients with HCC who were at high risk of postoperative recurrence including tumor diameter >5 cm, multinodular tumors and MVI-positive. In patients with tumor diameter ≤5 cm, single tumor or MVI-negative. PA-TACE does not appear to improve outcomes and may potentially promote postoperative recurrence in certain patients.",0

A systematic review with meta-analysis,"OBJECTIVE This study aimed to examine (1) the independent effects of hypoxia on cognitive function and (2) the effects of exercise on cognition while under hypoxia. METHODS Design: Systematic review with meta-analysis. DATA SOURCES PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, PsychInfo, and SPORTDiscus were searched. Eligibility criteria for selecting studies: randomized controlled trials and nonrandomized controlled studies that investigated the effects of chronic or acute exercise on cognition under hypoxia were considered (Aim 2), as were studies investigating the effects of hypoxia on cognition (Aim 1). RESULTS In total, 18 studies met our inclusionary criteria for the systematic review, and 12 studies were meta-analyzed. Exposure to hypoxia impaired attentional ability (standardized mean difference (SMD) = -0.4), executive function (SMD = -0.18), and memory function (SMD = -0.26), but not information processing (SMD = 0.27). Aggregated results indicated that performing exercise under a hypoxia setting had a significant effect on cognitive improvement (SMD = 0.3, 95% confidence interval: 0.14 - 0.45, I2 = 54%, p < 0.001). Various characteristics (e.g., age, cognitive task type, exercise type, exercise intensity, training type, and hypoxia level) moderated the effects of hypoxia and exercise on cognitive function. CONCLUSION Exercise during exposure to hypoxia improves cognitive function. This association appears to be moderated by individual and exercise/hypoxia-related characteristics.",0
https://doi.org/10.1210/clinem/dgz295,Medical Management of Patients After Atypical Femur Fractures: a Systematic Review and Recommendations From the European Calcified Tissue Society,"Abstract Context Atypical femur fractures (AFFs) are serious adverse events associated with bisphosphonates and often show poor healing. Evidence acquisition We performed a systematic review to evaluate effects of teriparatide, raloxifene, and denosumab on healing and occurrence of AFF. Evidence synthesis We retrieved 910 references and reviewed 67 papers, including 31 case reports, 9 retrospective and 3 prospective studies on teriparatide. There were no RCTs. We pooled data on fracture union (n = 98 AFFs on teriparatide) and found that radiological healing occurred within 6 months of teriparatide in 13 of 30 (43%) conservatively managed incomplete AFFs, 9 of 10 (90%) incomplete AFFs with surgical intervention, and 44 of 58 (75%) complete AFFs. In 9 of 30 (30%) nonoperated incomplete AFFs, no union was achieved after 12 months and 4 (13%) fractures became complete on teriparatide. Eight patients had new AFFs during or after teriparatide. AFF on denosumab was reported in 22 patients, including 11 patients treated for bone metastases and 8 without bisphosphonate exposure. Denosumab after AFF was associated with recurrent incomplete AFFs in 1 patient and 2 patients of contralateral complete AFF. Eight patients had used raloxifene before AFF occurred, including 1 bisphosphonate-naïve patient. Conclusions There is no evidence-based indication in patients with AFF for teriparatide apart from reducing the risk of typical fragility fractures, although observational data suggest that teriparatide might result in faster healing of surgically treated AFFs. Awaiting further evidence, we formulate recommendations for treatment after an AFF based on expert opinion.",0

The aim of this systematic review and meta-analysis was to investigate the effect of lymphadenectomy on survival in GBC surgery. On May 19, 2019, MEDLINE, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Library were searched for English or German articles published since 2002. Studies assessing the effect of lymphadenectomy on survival in GBC surgery were included. Fixed effect and random effects models were used to summarise the hazard ratio (HR). Of the 530 identified articles, 18 observational studies (27,570 patients, 10 population-based, 8 cohort studies) were reviewed. In the meta-analysis, lymphadenectomy did not show a significant benefit for T1a tumours (n = 495; HR, 1.37; 95%CI, 0.65–2.86; P = 0.41). Lymphadenectomy showed a significant survival benefit in T1b (n = 1618; HR, 0.69; 95%CI, 0.50–0.94; P = 0.02) and T2 (n = 6204; HR, 0.68; 95%CI, 0.56–0.83; P < 0.01) tumours. Lymphadenectomy improved survival in the 2 studies assessing T3 tumours (n = 1961). A conclusive analysis was not possible for T4 tumours due to a low case load. Among patients undergoing lymphadenectomy, improved survival was observed in patients with a higher number of resected lymph nodes (HR, 0.57; 95%CI, 0.45–0.71; P < 0.01). Regional lymphadenectomy improves survival in T1b to T3 GBC. A minimum of 6 retrieved lymph nodes are necessary for adequate staging, indicating a thorough lymphadenectomy. Patients with T1a tumours should be evaluated for lymphadenectomy, especially if lymph node metastases are suspected.",0

Methods A systematic literature search of Embase and Ovid-MEDLINE was undertaken for primary studies relevant to the presence of HPV in surgical smoke, contamination of OT staff with HPV after performing or attending smoke-generating surgical procedures, and the presence of HPV or HPV-related disease in OT staff following occupational surgical smoke exposure. Additional articles were identified by searching the reference lists of relevant published papers. Results Twenty-one relevant articles were identified. These demonstrate that surgical smoke from the treatment of HPV-related lesions can contain HPV DNA, and that this can contaminate the upper airways of OT staff. Whether this corresponds to infectious virus is not known. Increased prevalence of HPV infection or HPV-related disease in OT staff following occupational exposure to surgical smoke has not been convincingly shown. Conclusions While HPV transmission to OT staff from surgical smoke remains unproven, it would be safest to treat surgical smoke as potentially infectious. Necessary precautions should be taken when performing smoke-generating procedures, consisting of: (1) local exhaust ventilation, (2) general room ventilation and (3) full personal protective equipment including a fit tested particulate respirator of at least N95 grade. There is currently insufficient evidence to recommend HPV vaccination for OT staff or to state that the above precautions, when used properly, would not be effective at preventing HPV transmission from surgical smoke.",0

We aimed to compare the outcome of PMVR with optimal medical therapy (OMT) versus OMT alone in patients with secondary mitral regurgitation (MR) and to assess the role of potential effect modifiers. Methods: We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of 2 randomized clinical trials (RCT) and 7 non-randomized observational studies (nROS). Hazard ratios (HR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were pooled through inverse variance random-effects model to compute the summary effect size for all-cause death, cardiovascular death and cardiac-related hospitalization. Subgroup and meta-regression analysis were also performed. Results: An overall population of 3118 individuals (67% men; mean age, 73 years) was included: 1775 PMVR+OMT and 1343 OMT patients, with mean follow-up of 24 ± 15 months. PMVR+OMT was associated with a lower risk of all-cause death (HR: 0.77; 95% CI: 0.68–0.87), cardiovascular death (HR: 0.55; 95% CI: 0.34–0.89) and cardiac-related hospitalization (HR:0.77; 95% CI: 0.64–0.92). Meta-regression analysis showed that larger left ventricular end-diastolic volume index (LVEDVI) portends higher risk of all-cause death, cardiovascular death and cardiac-related hospitalization after PMVR (p < 0.001 for all). Conclusions: This study-level meta-analysis shows that PMVR+OMT is associated with reduced all-cause death, cardiovascular death and cardiac-related hospitalization when compared with OMT alone in secondary MR. LVEDVI is a predictive marker of efficacy, as patients with smaller LVEDVI have been shown to derive the largest benefit from PMVR. (Less)",0
https://doi.org/10.1007/s40265-020-01296-x,Are Generic Drugs Used in Cardiology as Effective and Safe as their Brand-name Counterparts? A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis,"Previous systematic reviews (2008; 2016) concluded similarity in outcomes between brand-name and generic drugs in cardiology, but they included ≥ 50% comparative bioavailability studies, not designed or powered to detect a difference in efficacy or safety between drug types. We aimed to summarise best-evidence regarding the effectiveness and safety of generic versus brand-name drugs used in cardiology. For this systematic review of the literature, scientific databases (MEDLINE and EMBASE) were searched from January 1984 to October 2018. Original research reports comparing the clinical impact of brand-name versus generic cardiovascular drugs on humans treated in a real-life setting, were selected. Meta-analyses and subgroup analyses were performed. Heterogeneity (I2) and risk of bias were tested. Among the 3148 screened abstracts, 72 met the inclusion criteria (n ≥ 1,000,000 patients, mean age 65 ± 10 years; 42% women). A total of 60% of studies showed no difference between drug types, while 26% concluded that the brand-name drug was more effective or safe, 13% were inconclusive and only 1% concluded that generics did better. The overall crude risk ratio of all-cause hospital visits for generic versus brand-name drug was 1.14 (95% confidence interval: 1.06–1.23; I2: 98%), while it was 1.05 (0.98–1.14; I2: 68%) for cardiovascular hospital visits. The crude risk ratio was not statistically significant for randomised controlled trials only (n = 4; 0.92 [0.63–1.34], I2: 35%). The crude risk of hospital visits was higher for patients exposed to generic compared to brand-name cardiovascular drugs. However, the evidence is insufficient and too heterogeneous to draw any firm conclusion regarding the effectiveness and safety of generic drugs in cardiology.",0
https://doi.org/10.1111/phn.12701,Effect of greenness on asthma in children: A systematic review,"Greenness such as trees, plants, and shrubs may positively influence mental and physical health, but the relationship between greenness and asthma is poorly understood. Because asthma is the most prevalent child respiratory disease internationally, elucidating the role of greenness may substantially benefit public health. The purpose of this systematic review was to synthesize findings related to effects of greenness on asthma in children. Following PRISMA guidelines, six databases were searched for international publication of primary research results relevant to the relationship between greenness and child asthma. Of 82 initial results, seven articles remained after removal of duplicates and applying exclusion criteria. Six reported no direct association between greenness and child asthma, while one found increased greenness protective for asthma. None found a negative direct association between greenness and child asthma. Evidence supported benefits of greenness on child asthma through mediation of factors such as exposure to tobacco smoke, high traffic volume, and difficult family relationships. Even without a direct association, greenness can be considered a public health asset as it may mediate other factors contributing to asthma in children. Public health nurses can use these findings to educate clients and partners while advocating for policies to protect greenness.",1

Exposure to ambient air pollution during pregnancy may cause pregnancy complications. The aim of our study is to explore the risk of trimester-specific maternal exposure to air pollutants on complications of pregnancy.PubMed, EMBASE, Web of Science, and Cochrane were systematically searched for cohort studies published before October 27, 2019 which reported the association between ambient air pollutants (PM2.5, PM10, CO, NO, NO2, NOx, O3, and SO2) and pregnancy complications (GDM, HDP, preeclampsia, and gestational hypertension) during different exposure windows. A meta-analysis was applied to combine relative risks (RRs) and their confidence intervals (CIs) from eligible studies. Quality assessment was conducted and Egger test was used to evaluate the publication bias. All statistical analyses were performed by STATA software (Version 15, StataCorp, College Station, Texas, USA).This meta-analysis consisted of 33 cohort studies conducted on 22,253,277 pregnant women. Meta-analyses showed during the first trimester, there were significant associations of PM10 with gestational hypertension (RR = 1.07, 95% CI: 1.02-1.12 per 10 μg/m3, I2 = 0.0%), of SO2 with GDM (RR = 1.04, 95% CI: 1.00-1.08 per 1 ppb increment, I2 = 54.1%), of PM2.5 with preeclampsia (RR = 0.97, 95% CI: 0.95-1.00 per 5 μg/m3, I2 = 4.1%). During the entire pregnancy, PM2.5 significantly increased the risk of hypertensive disorders of pregnancy (RR = 1.18, 95% CI: 1.02-1.34 per 5 μg/m3, I2 = 85.1%). Egger test indicated that wide-scale publication bias was unlikely.Maternal exposure to ambient air pollutants is associated with pregnancy complications especially during the first trimester. Further large multicenter cohort studies considering different constituents of pollutants, levels of disease severity, sensitive populations, and various exposure windows are warranted in the future research.",1

To systematically review the literature and perform a quantitative synthesis to evaluate the effect of EDs on testicular function. A comprehensive search was conducted in the MEDLINE, Scopus, and CENTRAL databases. Eligible for the systematic review were observational (cross-sectional and cohort) studies with (i) adult men who had a high probability of postnatal exposure to EDs (“exposed”), (ii) adult men who had a low probability of postnatal exposure to EDs (“non-exposed”), and (iii) an outcome of interest [seminal parameters and reproductive hormone concentrations]. The continuous outcomes in each of the studies were synthesized by the random effects model and expressed as standardized mean difference (SMD) with 95% confidence interval (CI). Thirteen studies, including 959 exposed and 907 non-exposed men, fulfilled the inclusion criteria. Exposure to EDs was associated with decreased LH [SMD − 0.17, 95% CI − 0.33 to − 0.02, 10 studies (616 exposed, 563 non-exposed), I2 40%, p = 0.09], progressive motility [SMD − 0.45, 95% CI − 0.77 to − 0.13, three studies (133 cases, 153 controls), I2 38%, p = 0.20], and normal morphology [SMD − 0.50, 95% CI − 0.85 to − 0.14, eight studies (562 cases, 540 controls), I2 87%, p < 0.01] compared with non-exposure. No difference was observed between the other study groups. Postnatal exposure to EDs is associated with decreased semen quality. Nevertheless, there is no evidence that a disruption of testicular function mediates the deterioration in semen quality.",1

Although previous studies have shown the combination therapy of sorafenib and TACE to be safe, there is no consensus regarding its efficacy. This systematic review and meta-analysis, which was based on the findings of comparative clinical trials, was conducted to provide up-to-date and comprehensive information about the efficacy of combination therapy versus TACE monotherapy in unresectable HCC.Multiple databases were systematically reviewed to screen studies through particular inclusion criteria. Hazard ratio (HR) with 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) was collected and analyzed by Revman 5.3 in a fixed or random effects meta-analysis model. Adverse events (AEs) were also evaluated.This review ultimately included 14 comparative studies focused on combination therapy versus TACE monotherapy. Of these: 5 studies conducted TACE plus sorafenib versus TACE with placebo; 9 studies provided overall survival (OS) in combination groups which ranged from 10.3 to 29.7 months; and 10 studies provided time to progression (TTP) in combination groups which ranged from 2.6 to 10.8 months. The disease control rate (DCR) in combination groups ranged from 9.7% to 89.2% in 7 of the studies. After performing a random effects meta-analysis model, our study showed that OS (HR =0.65, 95% CI: 0.54-0.79, P<0.0001) and TTP (HR =0.72, 95% CI: 0.59-0.88, P=0.001) have been significantly improved in the combination therapy group when compared with the TACE monotherapy group. AEs mainly included hand-foot skin reaction (HFSR), fatigue and diarrhea and the majority of these were in grade 1 or grade 2.Combination therapy has significant advantages over TACE monotherapy in terms of improving TTP and OS.",0

Methods A systematic review was conducted using the following key words: ‘otolaryngology’, ‘otorhinolaryngology’, ‘ENT’, ‘ENT surgery’, ‘ear, nose and throat surgery’, ‘head and neck surgery’, ‘thyroid surgery’, ‘parathyroid surgery’, ‘otology’, ‘rhinology’, ‘laryngology’ ‘skull base surgery’, ‘airway surgery’, ‘non-technical skills’, ‘non technical skills for surgeons’, ‘NOTSS’, ‘behavioural markers’ and ‘behavioural assessment tool’. Results Three publications were included in the review – 1 randomised, controlled trial and 2 cohort studies – involving 78 participants. All were simulation-based studies involving training otolaryngology surgeons. Conclusion Little research has been undertaken on non-technical skills in otolaryngology. Training surgeons’ non-technical skill levels are similar across every tested aspect. The research already performed can guide further studies, particularly amongst non-training otolaryngology surgeons and in both emergency and elective non-simulated environments.",0

Tofacitinib is effective in treatment of ulcerative colitis, but there are safety concerns. We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis to investigate the safety profile of tofacitinib, upadacitinib, filgotinib, and baricitinib in patients with rheumatoid arthritis, inflammatory bowel diseases, psoriasis, or ankylosing spondylitis. Methods We searched the MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials from January 1, 1990, through July 1, 2019. We performed a manual review of conference databases from 2012 through 2018. The primary outcome was incidence rates of adverse events (AEs) and serious AEs. We also estimated incidence rates of serious infections, herpes zoster infection, non-melanoma skin cancer, other malignancies, major cardiovascular events, venous thromboembolism, and mortality. We performed a meta-analysis, which included controlled studies, to assess the relative risk of these events. Results We identified 973 studies; of these, 82 were included in the final analysis, comprising 66,159 patients with immune-mediated diseases who were exposed to a JAK inhibitor. Two-thirds of the included studies were randomized controlled trials. The incidence rate of AEs was 42.65 per 100 person-years and of serious AEs was 9.88 per 100 person-years. Incidence rates of serious infections, herpes zoster infection, malignancy, and major cardiovascular events were 2.81 per 100 person-years, 2.67 per 100 person-years, 0.89 per 100 person-years, and 0.48 per 100 person-years, respectively. Mortality was not increased in patients treated with JAK inhibitors compared with patients given placebo or active comparator (relative risk 0.72; 95% confidence interval 0.40-1.28). The meta-analysis showed a significant increase in risk of herpes zoster infection among patients who received JAK inhibitors (relative risk 1.57; 95% confidence interval 1.04-2.37). Conclusions In a systematic review and meta-analysis, we found an increased risk of herpes zoster infection among patients with immune-mediated diseases treated with JAK inhibitors. All other AEs were not increased among patients treated with JAK inhibitors.",0

Method Systematic review and meta-regression of biochemically verified smoking cessation rates on BCTs in interventions and comparators in randomized controlled trials, adjusting for a priori-defined potential confounding variables, together with moderation analyses. Studies were drawn from the Cochrane Tobacco Addiction Group Specialised Register. Data were extracted from published and unpublished (i.e. obtained from study authors) study materials by two independent coders. Adequately described intervention (k = 143) and comparator (k = 92) groups were included in the analyses (n = 43 992 participants). Using bivariate mixed-effects meta-regressions, while controlling for key a priori confounders, we regressed smoking cessation on (a) three BCT groupings consistent with dual-process theory (i.e. associative, reflective motivational and self-regulatory), (b) 17 expert-derived BCT groupings (i.e. BCT taxonomy version 1 clusters) and (c) individual BCTs from the BCT taxonomy version 1. Results Among person-delivered interventions, higher smoking cessation rates were predicted by BCTs targeting associative and self-regulatory processes (B = 0.034, 0.041, P < 0.05), and by three individual BCTs (prompting commitment, social reward, identity associated with changed behaviour). Among written interventions, BCTs targeting taxonomy cluster 10a (rewards) predicted higher smoking cessation (B = 0.394, P < 0.05). Moderation effects were observed for nicotine dependence, mental health status and mode of delivery. Conclusions Among person-delivered behavioural smoking cessation interventions, specific behaviour change techniques and clusters of techniques are associated with higher success rates.",0

Cutaneous T cell-mediated reactions classically occur more than 6 hours after drug administration and include life-threatening conditions such as toxic epidermal necrolysis, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, and hypersensitivity syndrome. Over the last 20 years, significant advances have been made in our understanding of the pathogenesis of DHRs with the identification of human leukocyte antigens as predisposing factors. This has led to the development of pharmacogenetic screening tests, such as HLA-B*57:01 in abacavir therapy, which has successfully reduced the incidence of abacavir hypersensitivity reactions. We have completed a PRISMA-compliant systematic review to identify genetic associations that have been reported in DHRs. In total, 105 studies (5554 cases and 123 548 controls) have been included in the review reporting genetic associations with carbamazepine (n = 31), other aromatic antiepileptic drugs (n = 24), abacavir (n = 11), nevirapine (n = 14), trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (n = 11), dapsone (n = 4), allopurinol (n = 10), and other drugs (n = 5). The most commonly reported genetic variants associated with DHRs are located in human leukocyte antigen genes and genes involved in drug metabolism pathways. Increasing our understanding of genetic variants that contribute to DHRs will allow us to improve diagnosis, develop new treatments, and predict and prevent DHRs in the future.",0
https://doi.org/10.1111/cen.14161,Prognostic role of parafibromin staining and <i>CDC73</i> mutation in patients with parathyroid carcinoma: A systematic review and meta‐analysis based on individual patient data,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE Parathyroid carcinoma (PC) is a rare malignant neoplasm with a relatively poor prognosis. The loss of parafibromin expression or the presence of CDC73 mutation has been found to be remarkably associated with malignancy in parathyroid tumours. However, the prognostic role of them in PC has not yet been shown due to sampling limitations. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis based on individual patient data to clarify the performance of parafibromin immunohistochemical staining and CDC73 gene sequencing in predicting outcomes for patients PC. METHODS Published studies from PubMed/MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane and Scopus Databases were searched using the terms 'parafibromin', 'CDC73', 'HRPT2' and 'parathyroid' to identify eligible studies. From the included studies, the survival data of patients with PC were extracted, and a Cox proportional hazards model was used to assess hazard ratio (HR) for disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS). RESULTS A total of 193 patients from 9 studies were included in this survival analysis. Negative immunohistochemical staining of parafibromin was shown to be a risk factor for recurrence/metastasis (HR 2.73, P = .002) and death (HR 2.54, P = .004). Patient age ≥ 50 years was significantly related to lower OS (HR 2.37, P = .004) but not to DFS. CDC73 mutation was not statistically related to DFS or OS. CONCLUSIONS Negative parafibromin staining indicated a higher risk of recurrence/metastasis and mortality. The immunohistochemical staining of parafibromin seems to be more promising in predicting outcomes for patients with PC than the sequencing of CDC73.",0
https://doi.org/10.1200/jgo.19.00201,Mobile Technologies and Cervical Cancer Screening in Low- and Middle-Income Countries: A Systematic Review,"PURPOSE Cervical cancer screening is not well implemented in many low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). Mobile health (mHealth) refers to utilization of mobile technologies in health promotion and disease management. We aimed to qualitatively synthesize published articles reporting the impact of mHealth on cervical cancer screening–related health behaviors. METHODS Three reviewers independently reviewed articles with the following criteria: the exposure or intervention of interest was mHealth, including messages or educational information sent via mobile telephone or e-mail; the comparison was people not using mHealth technology to receive screening-related information, and studies comparing multiple different mHealth interventional strategies were also eligible; the primary outcome was cervical cancer screening uptake, and secondary outcomes included awareness, intention, and knowledge of screening; appropriate research designs included randomized controlled trials and quasi-experimental or observational research; and the study was conducted in an LMIC. RESULTS Of the 8 selected studies, 5 treated mobile telephone or message reminders as the exposure or intervention, and 3 compared the effects of different messages on screening uptake. The outcomes were diverse, including screening uptake (n = 4); health beliefs regarding the Papanicolaou (Pap) test (n = 1); knowledge of, attitude toward, and adherence to colpocytologic examination (n = 1); interest in receiving messages about Pap test results or appointment (n = 1); and return for Pap test reports (n = 1). CONCLUSION Overall, our systematic review suggests that mobile technologies, particularly telephone reminders or messages, lead to increased Pap test uptake; additional work is needed to unequivocally verify whether mhealth interventions can improve knowledge regarding cervical cancer. Our study will inform mHealth-based interventions for cervical cancer screening promotion in LMICs.",0

A systematic review,"Epidemiological studies indicate that gene-environment interactions play a role in atopic dermatitis (AD).To review the evidence for gene-environment interactions in AD aetiology, focusing on filaggrin (FLG) loss-of-function mutations.A systematic search from inception to September 2018 in Embase, MEDLINE and BIOSIS was performed. Search terms included all synonyms for AD and filaggrin/FLG; any genetic or epidemiological study design using any statistical methods were included. Quality assessment using criteria modified from guidance (ROBINS-I and Human Genome Epidemiology Network) for nonrandomized and genetic studies was completed, including consideration of power. Heterogeneity of study design and analyses precluded the use of meta-analysis.Of 1817 papers identified, 12 studies fulfilled the inclusion criteria required and performed formal interaction testing. There was some evidence for FLG-environment interactions in six of the studies (P-value for interaction ≤ 0·05), including early-life cat ownership, older siblings, water hardness, phthalate exposure, higher urinary phthalate metabolite levels (which all increased AD risk additional to FLG null genotype) and prolonged breastfeeding (which decreased AD risk in the context of FLG null genotype). Major limitations of published studies were the low numbers of individuals (ranging from five to 94) with AD and FLG loss-of-function mutations and exposure to specific environmental factors, and variation in exposure definitions.Evidence on FLG-environment interactions in AD aetiology is limited. However, many of the studies lacked large enough sample sizes to assess these interactions fully. Further research is needed with larger sample sizes and clearly defined exposure assessment.

https://doi.org/10.1016/j.artmed.2020.101836,Reinforcement learning application in diabetes blood glucose control: A systematic review,"Abstract Background Reinforcement learning (RL) is a computational approach to understanding and automating goal-directed learning and decision-making. It is designed for problems which include a learning agent interacting with its environment to achieve a goal. For example, blood glucose (BG) control in diabetes mellitus (DM), where the learning agent and its environment are the controller and the body of the patient respectively. RL algorithms could be used to design a fully closed-loop controller, providing a truly personalized insulin dosage regimen based exclusively on the patient’s own data. Objective In this review we aim to evaluate state-of-the-art RL approaches to designing BG control algorithms in DM patients, reporting successfully implemented RL algorithms in closed-loop, insulin infusion, decision support and personalized feedback in the context of DM. Methods An exhaustive literature search was performed using different online databases, analyzing the literature from 1990 to 2019. In a first stage, a set of selection criteria were established in order to select the most relevant papers according to the title, keywords and abstract. Research questions were established and answered in a second stage, using the information extracted from the articles selected during the preliminary selection. Results The initial search using title, keywords, and abstracts resulted in a total of 404 articles. After removal of duplicates from the record, 347 articles remained. An independent analysis and screening of the records against our inclusion and exclusion criteria defined in Methods section resulted in removal of 296 articles, leaving 51 relevant articles. A full-text assessment was conducted on the remaining relevant articles, which resulted in 29 relevant articles that were critically analyzed. The inter-rater agreement was measured using Cohen Kappa test, and disagreements were resolved through discussion. Conclusions The advances in health technologies and mobile devices have facilitated the implementation of RL algorithms for optimal glycemic regulation in diabetes. However, there exists few articles in the literature focused on the application of these algorithms to the BG regulation problem. Moreover, such algorithms are designed for control tasks as BG adjustment and their use have increased recently in the diabetes research area, therefore we foresee RL algorithms will be used more frequently for BG control in the coming years. Furthermore, in the literature there is a lack of focus on aspects that influence BG level such as meal intakes and physical activity (PA), which should be included in the control problem. Finally, there exists a need to perform clinical validation of the algorithms.",0

Clinical Relevance The association between GA focality (i.e., unifocal vs. multifocal lesions) and enlargement rate is inconsistent in the literature. Some studies report a comparable growth rate between unifocal and multifocal GA, whereas others suggest the growth rate varies widely between the 2 groups. Methods We searched 5 literature databases up to May 3, 2019, for studies that classified treatment-naive GA patients based on lesion focality. We performed a random effects meta-analysis to determine the growth rates of GA. To account for different entry times among cohorts, we introduced a horizontal translation factor to the dataset of each cohort. Heterogeneity and study quality were assessed using the I2 statistic and Quality in Prognosis Studies tool, respectively. Publication bias was evaluated by funnel plots and the Egger test. Results We included 12 studies with 3489 eyes from 3001 patients. After the introduction of translation factors, the effective radius of unifocal and multifocal GA enlarged linearly over approximately 7 years. The effective radius growth rate of multifocal GA (0.199±0.012 mm/year) was 46.3% higher than the growth rate of unifocal GA (0.136±0.008 mm/year; P 2 and 3 ). This difference disappeared after we accounted for different baseline total perimeters between unifocal and multifocal groups. The measured GA growth rate was consistent across studies using color fundus photography, fundus autofluorescence, or OCT (P = 0.35–0.99). Conclusions The effective radius of GA enlarges linearly and steadily over time in both unifocal and multifocal GA. The lesion focality is a significant prognostic factor for the GA effective radius growth rate. We propose that the growth rate of GA area is directly proportional to the total lesion perimeter (a measure of the number of retinal pigment epithelium cells exposed at the lesion border). Additional studies are needed to understand the cellular mechanisms underlying this relationship.",0

This review describes whether work-related risk factors are associated with IH. Methods A systematic review was performed in Medline via PubMed until February 3rd, 2020. Inclusion criteria were that IH was diagnosed by a clinician, and workers exposed to work-related risk factors were compared to workers less exposed or not at all. A quality assessment and a meta-analysis using Cochrane’s RevMan 5.3 were performed, including GRADE for quality of evidence. Results The search resulted in 540 references. Fourteen studies fulfilled the inclusion criteria, of which three were included in a meta-analysis, all three being of high quality, including 621 workers diagnosed with IH. The meta-analysis revealed significant associations with physically demanding work (OR 2.30, 95% CI 1.56–3.40). Two prospective studies, including 382 and 22,926 cases revealed associations that this was true for male workers with a lateral IH that reported standing or walking for more than six hours per workday (OR 1.45, 95% CI 1.12–1.88) or lifting cumulative loads of more than 4000 kg per workday (OR 1.32, 95% CI 1.27–1.38). The level of certainty for the latter two work-related risk factors was moderate and high according to GRADE. Conclusion Lateral IH among males is associated with work-related risk factors depending on the level of exposure to the time standing/walking per workday, or the amount of load lifted per workday.",1

Method This systematic review was carried out in agreement with PRISMA recommendations. PubMed/MEDLINE, SCOPUS, Virtual Health Library, Web of Science, CAPES Periodicals and CINAHL databases were searched for studies without date or language limitations. Search strategies were developed for identifying studies examining knowledge, attitudes and practice toward vaginal pessaries use. Two reviewers independently screened titles and abstracts to identify eligible studies. Data extraction was performed independently in duplicate into a standardized form. Quality of included studies was assessed using the Joanna Briggs Institute quality assessment tool. The protocol was registered with the PROSPERO International prospective register of systematic reviews [CRD42018114236]. Results Fourteen studies were included. Knowledge and practice were the main domains investigated among patients and professionals, respectively. The results demonstrated poor patient knowledge; however, in urogynecologic patients, knowledge was better. Previous consultation with a Female Pelvic Medicine and Reconstructive Surgery specialist (p = .001) and a higher level of education (p = .006) were associated with improved knowledge of pessary use. Fear of vaginal discharge, irritation, bleeding, and pain were factors that supported the decision not to use a pessary. Previous consultation with a generalist gynecologist (p = .03)and a lower level of education (p = .03) predicted aversion to pessary use. Providers demonstrated adequate knowledge and recommended pessary in 86.4% to 98.0% of cases. Having specialist and pessary management training were some factors that influenced a better attitude towards pessaries among health professionals. Conclusion The knowledge, attitudes and practice of women and health care providers about pessary use are seldom investigated. Developing a psychometrically valid instrument for assessment of knowledge, attitudes and practice is desirable to examine the complex interactions between these three constructs, expose barriers to pessary care, and develop targeted educational interventions",0

We present a protocol for a systematic review and meta-analysis of contamination to insecticides, herbicides and fungicides of products from honeybees, and an estimation of how much the consumption of these products contributes to the ADI (Acceptable Daily Intake) of selected substances. We aim to systematically review and meta-analyse studies on the contamination to plant protection products in honey, royal jelly, beeswax and propolis, applying the Navigation Guide and WHO-ILO systematic review methodology as an organizing framework. We will search electronic academic databases for potentially relevant records from PubMed, TOXNET and EMBASE. We will include quantitative studies analysing the contamination from insecticides, herbicides and fungicides in honey, propolis, royal jelly and beeswax. In particular, we will evaluate the presence of the following substances and classes of pesticides: Glyphosate, Chlorpyrifos, pyrethroid and neonicotinoid pesticides, fungicides and acaricides. At least two authors will independently screen titles and abstracts at a first stage of review, and full texts at a second stage, of potentially eligible records against the eligibility criteria; data extraction of included studies will then be performed by at least two authors, in blind. At least two authors will assess risk of bias and the quality of evidence, using the most suited tools currently available. The data on prevalence of contaminated samples and concentration of pesticides in the products will be combined using meta-analysis: when more than three studies reporting the necessary measures to fit the models are available, meta-analysis will be performed separately by product and by exposure; otherwise, weighted descriptive analysis will be performed. We will report the results using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines (PRISMA). • The presence of pesticides in honey and related products is an increasing concern for consumers and producers. • We present a protocol for a systematic review of human exposure to pesticide residues in honey and other bees’ products. • We will estimate of how much the consumption of these products contributes to the ADI of selected substances.",0

Despite the efficacy of the current treatments for opioid use disorder (OUD), including psychosocial interventions and medication-assisted therapy (MAT), many patients remain treatment-resistant and at high risk for overdose. A potential augmentation strategy includes the use of non-invasive brain stimulation (NIBS) techniques, such as transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS), and auricular vagus nerve stimulation (aVNS). These approaches may have therapeutic benefits by directly or indirectly modulating the neurocircuitry affected in OUD. In this review, we evaluate the available studies on NIBS in the context of OUD withdrawal and detoxification, maintenance, and cravings, while also considering analgesia and safety concerns. In the context of opioid withdrawal and detoxification, a percutaneous form of aVNS has positive results in open-label trials, but has not yet been tested against sham. No randomized studies have reported on the safety and efficacy of NIBS specifically for maintenance treatment in OUD. TMS and tDCS have demonstrated effects on cravings, although published studies were limited by small sample sizes. NIBS may play a role in reducing exposure to opioids and the risk of developing OUD, as demonstrated by studies using tDCS in an experimental pain condition and TMS in a post-operative setting. Overall, while the preliminary evidence and safety for NIBS in the prevention and treatment of OUD appears promising, further research is needed with larger sample sizes, placebo control, and objective biomarkers as outcome measures before strong conclusions can be drawn.",0
https://doi.org/10.1007/s12350-020-02093-5,Efficiency of tetrofosmin versus sestamibi achieved through shorter injection-to-imaging times: A systematic review of the literature,"Based on superior image quality, more accurate gated images, and lower radiation exposure to patients, Technetium-99m (Tc-99m) based tracers are preferred over Thallium-201 for SPECT myocardial perfusion imaging. The two Tc-99m tracers, sestamibi and tetrofosmin, have many similar characteristics but there are differences in blood and liver clearance rates, as well as the recommended time after injection for imaging to achieve optimal image quality. Because published peer-reviewed studies examining optimal times between injection and imaging are limited, it can be difficult to identify evidence-based opportunities to optimize imaging protocols. Using systematic literature review methods, this study was designed to identify and consolidate the available evidence on the use of sestamibi compared to tetrofosmin for variable injection to imaging times in regard to test efficiency, including test length and re-scan rates, and image quality, including overall quality and cardiac to extra-cardiac ratios. The composite of this data shows that earlier imaging with tetrofosmin is equivalent to later imaging with sestamibi when assessing subjective image quality or when quantifying heart-to-extra-cardiac ratios. Image quality and heart-to-extra-cardiac ratios comparing early versus later imaging with tetrofosmin were comparable if not equivalent to each other. The equivalency of the imaging quality occurs with 15 minutes (on average) earlier imaging compared to sestamibi and 30 minutes compared to standard time tetrofosmin. The subjective findings of equivalent image quality are also shown with objective measurements of heart-to-extra-cardiac ratios. In this review, the significantly shorter injection-to-acquisition times with tetrofosmin compared to sestamibi resulted in better efficiency and less waiting times for patients; in addition, significantly higher re-scan rates with sestamibi compared to tetrofosmin due to hepatic activity contributed to better throughput with tetrofosmin.",0

Risk-of-bias (RoB) assessment was performed according to the Cochrane 2.0 RoB tool or the Joanna Briggs Institute Checklist for non-randomized studies.A total of 5813 participants were included from 18 original articles (two randomized controlled trials [RCTs], 10 prospective studies, six retrospective studies). Urology sub-specialities comprised: uro-oncology (n = 6); general urology (n = 8); endo-urology (n = 2); and lower urinary tract symptoms and/or incontinence (n = 2). Across all sub-specialties, prospective studies using VCs reported a primary median (interquartile range [IQR]) VC discharge rate of 16.6 (14.7-29.8)% and a primary median (IQR) face-to-face (FTF) clinic referral rate of 32.4 (15.5-53.3)%. Direct cost analysis demonstrated median (IQR) annual cost savings of £56 232 (£46 260-£61 116). Grade II and IIIb complications were reported in two acute ureteric colic studies, with rates of 0.20% (3/1534) and 0.13% (2/1534), respectively. The annual carbon footprint avoided ranged from 0.7 to 4.35 metric tonnes of CO2 emissions, depending on the mode of transport used. Patient satisfaction was inconsistently reported, and assessments lacked prospective evaluation using validated questionnaires.Urology VCs are a promising new platform which can offer clinical, financial and environmental benefits to support an increasing urological referral burden. Further prospective evidence is required across urological sub-specialties to confirm equivalency and safety against traditional FTF assessment.",0
https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-020-62715-3,Systematic review of the epidemiology of acne vulgaris,"Abstract A systematic review was conducted on epidemiology studies on acne obtained from a Web of Science search to study risk factors associated with acne presentation and severity. A strong association was observed between several risk factors – family history, age, BMI and skin type – and acne presentation or severity in multiple studies. The pooled odds ratio of 2.36 (95% CI 1.97–2.83) for overweight/obese BMI with reference to normal/underweight BMI and the pooled odds ratio of 2.91 (95% CI 2.58–3.28) for family history in parents with reference to no family history in parents demonstrate this strong association. In addition, a pooled odds ratio of 1.07 (95% CI 0.42–2.71) was obtained for sex (males with reference to females). However, the association between other factors, such as dietary factors and smoking, and acne presentation or severity was less clear, with inconsistent results between studies. Thus, further research is required to understand how these factors may influence the development and severity of acne. This study summarizes the potential factors that may affect the risk of acne presentation or severe acne and can help researchers and clinicians to understand the epidemiology of acne and severe acne. Furthermore, the findings can direct future acne research, with the hope of gaining insight into the pathophysiology of acne so as to develop effective acne treatments.",0
https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pmed.1003126,Comparative impact of pharmacological treatments for gestational diabetes on neonatal anthropometry independent of maternal glycaemic control: A systematic review and meta-analysis,"Fetal growth in gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) is directly linked to maternal glycaemic control; however, this relationship may be altered by oral anti-hyperglycaemic agents. Unlike insulin, such drugs cross the placenta and may thus have independent effects on fetal or placental tissues. We investigated the association between GDM treatment and fetal, neonatal, and childhood growth.PubMed, Ovid Embase, Medline, Web of Science, ClinicalTrials.gov, and Cochrane databases were systematically searched (inception to 12 February 2020). Outcomes of GDM-affected pregnancies randomised to treatment with metformin, glyburide, or insulin were included. Studies including preexisting diabetes or nondiabetic women were excluded. Two reviewers independently assessed eligibility and risk of bias, with conflicts resolved by a third reviewer. Maternal outcome measures were glycaemic control, weight gain, and treatment failure. Offspring anthropometric parameters included fetal, neonatal, and childhood weight and body composition data. Thirty-three studies (n = 4,944), from geographical locations including Europe, North Africa, the Middle East, Asia, Australia/New Zealand, and the United States/Latin America, met eligibility criteria. Twenty-two studies (n = 2,801) randomised women to metformin versus insulin, 8 studies (n = 1,722) to glyburide versus insulin, and 3 studies (n = 421) to metformin versus glyburide. Eleven studies (n = 2,204) reported maternal outcomes. No differences in fasting blood glucose (FBS), random blood glucose (RBS), or glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) were reported. No studies reported fetal growth parameters. Thirty-three studies (n = 4,733) reported birth weight. Glyburide-exposed neonates were heavier at birth (58.20 g, 95% confidence interval [CI] 10.10-106.31, p = 0.02) with increased risk of macrosomia (odds ratio [OR] 1.38, 95% CI 1.01-1.89, p = 0.04) versus neonates of insulin-treated mothers. Metformin-exposed neonates were born lighter (-73.92 g, 95% CI -114.79 to -33.06 g, p < 0.001) with reduced risk of macrosomia (OR 0.60, 95% CI 0.45-0.79, p < 0.001) than insulin-exposed neonates. Metformin-exposed neonates were born lighter (-191.73 g, 95% CI -288.01 to -94.74, p < 0.001) with a nonsignificant reduction in macrosomia risk (OR 0.32, 95% CI 0.08-1.19, I2 = 0%, p = 0.09) versus glyburide-exposed neonates. Glyburide-exposed neonates had a nonsignificant increase in total fat mass (103.2 g, 95% CI -3.91 to 210.31, p = 0.06) and increased abdominal (0.90 cm, 95% CI 0.03-1.77, p = 0.04) and chest circumferences (0.80 cm, 95% CI 0.07-1.53, p = 0.03) versus insulin-exposed neonates. Metformin-exposed neonates had decreased ponderal index (-0.13 kg/m3, 95% CI -0.26 to -0.00, p = 0.04) and reduced head (-0.21, 95% CI -0.39 to -0.03, p = 0.03) and chest circumferences (-0.34 cm, 95% CI -0.62 to -0.05, p = 0.02) versus the insulin-treated group. Metformin-exposed neonates had decreased ponderal index (-0.09 kg/m3, 95% CI -0.17 to -0.01, p = 0.03) versus glyburide-exposed neonates. Study limitations include heterogeneity in dosing, heterogeneity in GDM diagnostic criteria, and few studies reporting longitudinal growth outcomes.Maternal randomisation to glyburide resulted in heavier neonates with a propensity to increased adiposity versus insulin- or metformin-exposed groups. Metformin-exposed neonates were lighter with reduced lean mass versus insulin- or glyburide-exposed groups, independent of maternal glycaemic control. Oral anti-hyperglycaemics cross the placenta, so effects on fetal anthropometry could result from direct actions on the fetus and/or placenta. We highlight a need for further studies examining the effects of intrauterine exposure to antidiabetic agents on longitudinal growth, and the importance of monitoring fetal growth and maternal glycaemic control when treating GDM. This review protocol was registered with PROSPERO (CRD42019134664/CRD42018117503).",0

This review aims to analyze the scientific evidence on respiratory and allergic effects of exposure to agricultural pesticides in children aged up to 12 years old. The databases PubMed, Web of Science, Scielo, and Lilacs were screened to select articles published in English, Spanish, or Portuguese, and 21 articles were included in this review. Most investigations were conducted in North America (mostly in the United States), while no studies conducted in Latin America or Africa were found, despite their intensive use of pesticides. Children are exposed to pesticides through multiple pathways from the prenatal period throughout later developmental stages and may experience several respiratory effects. Most studies (79%) found positive associations with pesticide exposure and children’s respiratory and allergic effects such as asthma, wheezing, coughs, acute respiratory infections, hay fever, rhinitis, eczema, chronic phlegm, and lung function impairments. Contrastingly, 21% of the studies found no associations between pesticide exposure and children’s respiratory health. The vast differences among the characteristics of the studies hamper any comparison of the results. Exposure to pesticides may have several impacts on childhood respiratory health. More studies must be conducted, especially in low- and middle-income countries, preferably with comparable research protocols adapted to local realities. Efforts should be made to develop comprehensive risk mitigation strategies and behavioral interventions to reduce children’s exposure to pesticides used in agriculture and respiratory health effects, and to ensure healthy childhood growth.",1
https://doi.org/10.1177/2192568219882346,Defining the MIS-TLIF: A Systematic Review of Techniques and Technologies Used by Surgeons Worldwide,"Systematic review.To date there is no consensus among surgeons as to what defines an MIS-TLIF (transforaminal lumbar interbody fusion using minimally invasive spine surgery) compared to an open or mini-open TLIF. This systematic review aimed to examine the MIS-TLIF techniques reported in the recent body of literature to help provide a definition of what constitutes the MIS-TLIF, based on the consensus of the majority of surgeons.We created a database of articles published about MIS-TLIF between 2010 and 2018. We evaluated the technical components of the MIS-TLIF including instruments and incisions used as well the order in which key steps are performed.We could identify several patterns for MIS-TLIF performance that seemed agreed upon by the majority of MIS surgeons: use of paramedian incisions; use of a tubular retractor to perform a total facetectomy, decompression, and interbody cage implantation; and percutaneous insertion of the pedicle-screw rod constructs with intraoperative imaging.Based on this review of the literature, the key features used by surgeons performing MIS TLIF include the use of nonexpandable or expandable tubular retractors, a paramedian or lateral incision, and the use of a microscope or endoscope for visualization. Approaches using expandable nontubular retractors, those that require extensive subperiosteal dissection from the midline laterally, or specular-based retractors with wide pedicle to pedicle exposure are far less likely to be promoted as an MIS-based approach. A definition is necessary to improve the communication among spine surgeons in research as well as patient education.",0
https://doi.org/10.4103/jcvjs.jcvjs_56_20,Management of metastatic vertebral lesions by interventional techniques: Systematic review of outcomes,"Vertebral metastases represent an important cause of cancer-related morbidity and mortality. Among all available treatments, interventional percutaneous techniques have recently emerged as potential strategies for the management of oncologic patients with vertebral lesions. Minimally invasive image-guided therapies include ""ablative"" and ""consolidative"" ones. According to the number of metastases and the patient's performance status, ablative techniques can be performed with a curative or a palliative purpose since necrosis induced by critic changes of intralesional temperature determines both tumor debulking and destruction of pain receptors. On the other hand, consolidative treatments are based on the injection of polymethylmethacrylate cement to improve structural vertebral integrity and obtain pain alleviation and prevention of skeletal-related events. This article reviews the current recommendations supporting the role of interventional radiology in the management of vertebral metastases, focusing on the last updates in literature.",0

This systematic review details the clinical manifestations, diagnostic methodology, and empirical anti-fungal therapy for this rare yeast. PubMed, LILACS, Scielo, and Web of Science databases were searched for articles about Pseudozyma spp. infections from inception to June 2019. Inclusion criteria were any published studies that included patients with Pseudozyma spp. infection. Infections were identified using criteria set forth by the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer, and were further classified according to clinical, laboratory, or radiologic findings, microbiologic confirmation, and response to therapy. Eleven articles were included with 15 patients. Oncological and/or hematological disorders were the most reported risk factors. Nontraditional microbiological methods correctly identified Pseudozyma spp., whereas traditional methods failed to identify fungal genus. Species were identified by sequencing, and most demonstrated a higher minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) for fluconazole and echinocandins. MICs for itraconazole, voriconazole, and posaconazole varied by species. All isolates were susceptible to amphotericin B, which was the most used treatment. Pseudozyma spp. infections usually present with fever and are diagnosed by blood culture. Most species studied appeared to be resistant to fluconazole and echinocandin. Voriconazole, posaconazole, and amphotericin were effective in treating P. aphidis. However, more studies are needed to evaluate voriconazole and posaconazole in species other than P. aphidis.",0

However, whether concomitant CIS affects the prognosis of UTUC is controversial. The objective of this study was to provide a comprehensive association between CIS and the prognosis of UTUC. Materials and methods Web of Science, PubMed, and Embase were searched to identify clinical studies about CIS and UTUC before July 2019. Newcastle Ottawa Scale was used to evaluate the quality of the literature. We calculated hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% CIs to evaluate the relationship between concomitant CIS and survival outcomes. Z test was used to pooled HRs, if P Results Total of 7,852 patients with UTUC were included, of which 1,004 (12.79%) concomitant CIS. In univariate analysis, our meta-analysis shows that concomitant CIS is associated with worse cancer-specific survival (HR: 1.54; P 0.05). Conclusions Our meta-analysis shows that concomitant CIS is associated with worse survival outcomes in UTUC after radical nephroureterectomy. CIS is an independent prognostic risk factor in UTUC.",0

We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of data from randomized controlled trials and high-quality real-world studies. Methods We performed a systematic search of the MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane Library, and ClinicalTrials.gov Website databases (through Oct 12, 2018) for randomized controlled trials and high-quality real-world studies that reported major GIB events in patients given NOACs or conventional therapy. Relative risks (RRs) for randomized controlled trials and adjusted hazard ratios (aHRs) for real-world studies were calculated separately using random-effects models. Results We analyzed data from 43 randomized controlled trials (183,752 patients) and 41 real-world studies (1,879,428 patients). The pooled major rates of GIB for patients on NOACs (1.19%) vs conventional treatment (0.92%) did not differ significantly (RR from randomized controlled trials, 1.09; 95% CI, 0.91–1.31 and aHR from real-world studies, 1.02; 95% CI, 0.94–1.10; Pinteraction=.52). Rivaroxaban, but not other NOACs, was associated with an increased risk for major GIB (RR from randomized controlled trials, 1.39; 95% CI, 1.17–1.65 and aHR from real-world studies, 1.14; 95% CI, 1.04–1.23; Pinteraction = .06). Analyses of subgroups, such as patients with different indications, dosage, or follow-up time, did not significantly affect results. Meta-regression analysis failed to detect any potential confounding to impact the primacy outcome. Conclusions In a systematic review and meta-analysis of data from randomized controlled trials and real-world studies, we confirmed that there is no significant difference in risk of major GIB between patients receiving NOACs vs conventional treatment. Rivaroxaban users had a 39% increase in risk for major GIB.",0

We searched seven electronic databases including MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane Library, and four Korean databases in June 2018. Studies that provided cultural competence educational interventions for health professionals and measured the impact on health professional outcomes, patient outcomes, or both were included. A narrative synthesis of study findings was performed.Eleven studies met the inclusion criteria. Studies used a randomized (n = 5) and a non-randomized controlled trial (n = 6) design and were conducted in the USA (n = 7), South Korea (n = 3), and Sweden (n = 1). Cultural competence education was provided mostly to those of single occupations, nurses (n = 5) or physicians (n = 4). The delivery mode was classroom (n = 7), online (n = 3), or blended learning (n = 1), using mainly lectures, discussions, and case studies as teaching and learning methods. Education duration ranged from less than 1 hr to 3 days. Nine studies reported significantly improved health professional outcomes compared to the control group. Patient outcomes were reported in three studies. Only one study reported significant effect on patient satisfaction (d = 0.94) and trust (d = 0.71). There was no significant effect on patient physiological outcomes.Cultural competence educational interventions had a positive effect on health professional outcomes. There is a considerable lack of research assessing patient outcomes, and there is limited evidence on whether interventions can change patient outcomes.",0
https://doi.org/10.1007/s00787-019-01420-7,"Experiences and satisfaction of children, young people and their parents with alternative mental health models to inpatient settings: a systematic review","Abstract Community-based mental health services for children and young people (CYP) can offer alternatives to inpatient settings and treat CYP in less restrictive environments. However, there has been limited implementation of such alternative models, and their efficacy is still inconclusive. Notably, little is known of the experiences of CYP and their parents with these alternative models and their level of satisfaction with the care provided. Therefore, the main aim of this review was to understand those experiences of the accessibility of alternative models to inpatient care, as well as overall CYP/parental satisfaction. A searching strategy of peer-reviewed articles was conducted from January 1990 to December 2018, with updated searches conducted in June 2019. The initial search resulted in 495 articles, of which 19 were included in this review. A narrative synthesis grouped the studies according to emerging themes: alternative models, tele-psychiatry and interventions applied to crisis, and experiences and satisfaction with crisis provision. The identified articles highlighted increased satisfaction in CYP with alternative models in comparison with care as usual. However, the parental experiential data identified high levels of parental burden and a range of complex emotional reactions associated with engagement with crisis services. Furthermore, we identified a number of interventions, telepsychiatric and mobile solutions that may be effective when applied to urgent and emergency care for CYP experiencing a mental health crisis. Lastly, both parental and CYP experiences highlighted a number of perceived barriers associated with help-seeking from crisis services.",0
https://doi.org/10.1177/1524838020925787,A Systematic Review of Corporal Punishment in Schools: Global Prevalence and Correlates,"Despite global shifts toward prevention of school corporal punishment, the practice remains widespread. This systematic review focused on (a) prevalence, (b) associated mental health and behavioral factors, and (c) correlates that may be risk or protective factors. Studies included in this review were peer-reviewed, published in English between 1980 and July 2017, and quantitative in design. Fifty-three papers met the inclusion criteria. All were cross-sectional surveys, predominantly of moderate quality and conducted in the United States (US) and on the African continent. Results indicated that school corporal punishment is prevalent across the globe (including where bans are in place) and does not appear to be decreasing over time, although measurement differences preclude firm conclusions. It is associated with physical, academic, mental health, and behavioral problems for children. Boys, Black students (in the US), and students exposed to violence at home were most at risk of corporal punishment. It is unclear whether disability puts a student at risk. Schools with high rates of other disciplinary practices were more likely to use corporal punishment, while those who employed a mental health professional and trained staff in safety procedures were less likely to use corporal punishment. Teacher attitudes favoring corporal punishment, and their use of violence in other contexts, increased risk. Low socioeconomic status (of the student or the school environment) increased risk, while high levels of state social capital reduced risk. Future research must include areas where corporal punishment is banned and focus on developing effective interventions to prevent school corporal punishment.",0

A systematic review,"Background: The clinical and preclinical exploration of the therapeutic properties of vitamin D have significantly increased in the past decade, owing to the growing associative evidence suggesting vitamin D is neuroprotective. However, whether depletion of vitamin D contributes to the onset of neurological disorders or is a symptom of neurological disease has yet to be defined. Much remains unclear about the causal role of vitamin D and the method of use and forms of vitamin D.Objectives: We sought to quantitatively assess if neuroprotective benefits from vitamin D in neurodegenerative diseases are dependent on route of administration: comparing the effect of endogenously sourced vitamin D from UV exposure to exogenously derived vitamin D through synthetic supplementation.Design: We systematically searched PubMed, Embase and PsycInfo databases which included both pre-clinical and clinical studies investigating vitamin D in neurodegenerative diseases. Articles were subject to strict inclusion criteria and objectively assessed for quality. Additionally, Medline data was analysed to identify trends in topic publications and linguistic characteristics of papers.Results: From a total of 231 screened articles, we identified 73 appropriate for review based on inclusion criteria: original studies that investigated vitamin D levels or levels of vitamin D supplementation in neurodegenerative diseases or investigated past/present sun exposure in disease cohorts. Results indicate there is insufficient evidence to comprehensively reflect on a potential neuroprotective role for vitamin D and if this was dependent on route of administration. The majority of current data supporting neuroprotective benefits from vitamin D are based on pre-clinical and observational studies. Solid evidence is lacking to support the current hypothesis that the beneficial effect of UV exposure results from the synthesis of vitamin D. Sun exposure, independent of vitamin D production, may be protective against multiple Sclerosis, Parkinson's disease and Alzheimer's disease. Yet, further research is required to elucidate the beneficial mechanism of actions of UV exposure. The literature of vitamin D and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis was limited, and no conclusions were drawn. Therefore, in cases where UV-derived vitamin D was hypothesized to be the beneficial mediator in the neuroprotective effects of sun exposure, we propose results are based only on associative evidence.Conclusion: On the basis of this systematic review, strong recommendations regarding therapeutic benefits of vitamin D in neurodegenerative disease cannot be made. It is unclear if vitamin D mediates a protective benefit in neurodegenerative disease or whether it is an associative marker of UV exposure, which may contribute to as of yet unidentified neuroprotective factors.",0

We systematically reviewed data on this topic by searching Medline, Cochrane, and Clinicaltrials.gov to identify randomized clinical trials (RCT) and observational studies that assessed the efficacy and safety of nicotine replacement therapy (NRT), varenicline, and bupropion in patients with stroke and TIA. We included studies that reported rates of smoking cessation, worsening or recurrent cerebrovascular disease, seizures, or neuropsychiatric events. We identified 2 RCTs and 6 observational studies; 3 included ischemic stroke and TIA, 2 subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH), and 3 did not specify. Four studies assessed efficacy; cessation rates ranged from 33% to 66% with pharmacological therapy combined with behavioral interventions versus 15% to 46% without, but no individual study demonstrated a statistically significant benefit. Safety data for varenicline and buopropion in ischemic stroke were scarce. Patients with SAH who received NRT had more seizures (9% vs 2%; P = 0.024) and delirium (19% vs 7%; P = 0.006) in one study, but less frequent vasospasm in 3 studies. In conclusion, combined with behavioral interventions, smoking-cessation therapies resulted in numerically higher cessation rates. Limited safety data may prompt caution regarding seizures and delirium in patients with subarachnoid hemorrhage.",0

Research design and methods Medline, EMBASE, Cochrane Library, and Scopus were searched for observational studies published up to March 2019. Five independent reviewers assessed in duplicate the eligibility of each study based on predefined eligibility criteria and two independent reviewers assessed risk of bias. Ameta-analysis was performed to calculate a pooled odds ratio (OR) or hazard ratio (HR) using random effects for glycemic measures in relation to the outcomes of wound healing and LEA. Subgroup analyses were conducted to explore potential source of heterogeneity between studies. The study protocol is registered with PROSPERO (CRD42018096842). Results Of 4572 study records screened, 60 observational studies met the study eligibility criteria of which 47 studies had appropriate data for inclusion in one or more meta-analyses(n = 12,604 DFUs). For cohort studies comparing A1C >7.0 to 7.5% vs. lower A1C levels, the pooled OR for LEA was 2.04 (95% CI, 0.91, 4.57) and for studies comparing A1C ≥ 8% vs. Conclusions Our findings suggest that A1C levels ≥8% and fasting glucose levels ≥126 mg/dl are associated with increased likelihood of LEA in patients with DFUs. A purposively designed prospective study is needed to better understand the mechanisms underlying the association between hyperglycemia and LEA.",0

The purpose of this study was to determine the contributing risk factors to the prevalence of (MDR-TB). Based on systematic review of the literatures, the prevalence of (MDR-TB) and associated risk factors in Malaysia were studied. A comprehensive search of Scopus, Science direct, PubMed, DOAJ, CINAHL Plus, MyJournal, BIREME, BMC Public Health, Medline, CAB, and WoS databases were done among the articles published from 31st January 2009 to 31st December 2018, by using medical subject heading (MeSH) key terms. In conducting this study, a total of 121 papers were reviewed and 23 research papers were chosen, because, they met the specific inclusion criteria. In this study, gender, age, marital status, ethnicity, homeless status, living in urban area and history of imprisonment were evaluated as demographic factors, while educational level and employment were evaluated as socioeconomic factors. Smoking, diabetes mellitus, drug abuse and alcohol consumption were evaluated as behavioral and co-morbidities factors. All the studies chosen as eligible to be included in this study were found to be significantly associated with the risk factors for the prevalence of (MDR-TB). It was also discovered that, lack of adequate knowledge among the community and (TB) patients might increase the progression of (MDR-TB) infection in Malaysia. Thus, carried out a systematic review provided a comprehensive assessment of the (MDR-TB) which might be useful for policy makers, health experts and researchers to implement appropriate strategies for (TB) infected population in Malaysia.",0
https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijheh.2020.113506,"A systematic review of water, sanitation and hygiene among Roma communities in Europe: Situation analysis, cultural context, and obstacles to improvement","Abstract Background The Roma are Europe's largest ethnic minority. Their history has been shaped by marginalization, stigmatization, discrimination, slavery, persecution and murder, and to date, they continue to face prejudice and social exclusion. The Roma population is generally poor, living in crowded and low quality housing in segregated communities on the outskirts of cities, often lacking basic physical infrastructure, including adequate water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH). To better understand the obstacles the Roma are facing, we aimed to review and synthesize available peer-reviewed literature, and identify obstacles to improvement. Methods We conducted the first systematic review of peer-reviewed literature on water, sanitation and hygiene among Roma communities in Europe, published between 2000 and 2020. A total of 30 publications met the inclusion criteria. We extracted data relating to WASH conditions and services, associated risk factors, exposures and outcomes, examined the role of cultural norms in shaping health behaviors, and obstacles to improvement. Results Our review shows that across Europe, Roma communities face more challenges than the majority population with respect to access to WASH, waste management and environmental hygiene, appropriate housing and hygienic living environments. Prominent themes in the literature to describe WASH conditions about European Roma populations include limited access, affordability, and quality of WASH services; self-management of WASH as response and adaptive tactic; unsafe WASH as a reason for eviction; and health risks associated with substandard WASH services. The same factors determining the poor quality of WASH services and environmental health impede their improvement. Major barriers to WASH access and affordability among the Roma include discrimination, social exclusion, lack of formal education, poverty, geography, legal and social aspects, and cultural perceptions of health risks, political top-down approaches, lack of political will, and lack of involvement of the Roma community in planning. Besides, Roma are not well represented in national statistics, with data collection being complicated not only by difficulties of access and underfunding, but also by distrust and culturally distinctive health beliefs. Conclusions The situation and cultural context of WASH among Roma is challenging and complex. Our review demonstrates not only the urgent need for action for Roma communities in particular, but may have broader applicability to ethnic and social minorities in other parts of the world.

The present systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to explore the linear and non-linear dose-response association between adherence to the DASH diet and all-cause and cause-specific mortality . Methods Database search was performed in PubMed, Scopus, and EMBASE for prospective cohort studies investigating the association between adherence to the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet and risk of mortality. Summary hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were estimated with the use of a random-effects model for the linear and nonlinear relationships. The two-stage hierarchical regression model was applied to test the potential non-linear dose-response associations. Results The inclusion criteria were met by 17 studies (13 publications). The scores reported for adherence to the DASH diet in different studies were converted to a conventional scoring method in which the adherence score might range between 8 to 40. The linear analysis revealed that summary HRs were 0.95 (95% CI: 0.94–0.96, I 2 = 91.6%, n = 14) for all-cause, 0.96 (95% CI: 0.95–0.98, I 2 = 82.4%, n = 12) for CVD, 0.97 (95% CI: 0.96–0.98, I 2 = 0.00%, n = 2) for stroke, and 0.97 (95% CI: 0.95–0.98, I 2 = 63.7%, n = 12) for cancer mortality per each 5-point increment of adherence to the DASH diet. There was also evidence of non-linear associations between the DASH diet and all-cause and cause-specific mortality as the associations became even more evident when the adherence scores were more than 20 points ( P &lt; 0.005). Conclusion Even the modest adherence to the DASH diet is associated with a lower risk of all-cause and cause-specific mortality. The higher adherence to the diet also strengthens the risk-reducing association.

Where possible, we calculated pooled hazard ratios (pHR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI), excluding studies considered to have the potential for immortal time bias (ITB) which, in practice, was the major source of bias. Results We identified 36 studies evaluating one or more of the medications (metformin n = 8, statins n = 12, beta-blockers n = 11, aspirin and/or NA-NSAIDs n = 9). We rated 21 studies as ITB-free. The meta-analysis of the ITB-free studies suggested improved survival in statin users compared to non-users (pHR: 0.76, 95%CI: 0.68–0.85), but no overall survival benefit associated with use of metformin, beta-blockers, aspirin or NA-NSAIDs. The pooled result of two studies did, however, suggest a possible association between perioperative beta-blocker use and improved survival. Studies considered to have potential ITB were more likely to report survival benefits associated with these medications. Conclusion Statin use is associated with better ovarian cancer survival but further study, preferably a clinical trial, is required. There are insufficient data to draw conclusions regarding metformin, beta-blockers, aspirin and NA-NSAIDs.",0

There is evidence that psychosocial factors modulate immune function; however, how this may influence TB risk or BCG vaccine response, and whether this pathway can be modified through social protection, has not been investigated. This paper aims to: a) systematically review evidence of how psychosocial factors influence the expression of biomarkers of immunity, and b) apply this general evidence to propose plausible TB-specific pathways for future study.Papers reporting on the impact of psychosocial stressors on immune biomarkers in relation to infectious disease risk were identified through a search of the databases MEDLINE, PsycINFO, Global Health and PsycEXTRA alongside reference list and citation searching of key papers. Data extraction and critical appraisal were carried out using a standardised form. The findings were tabulated and synthesised narratively by infectious disease category, and used to propose plausible mechanisms for how psychosocial exposures might influence immune outcomes relevant to TB and BCG response.27,026 citations were identified, of which 51 met the inclusion criteria. The literature provides evidence of a relationship between psychosocial factors and immune biomarkers. While the direction and strength of associations is heterogenous, some overarching patterns emerged: adverse psychosocial factors (e.g. stress) were generally associated with compromised vaccine response and higher antibody titres to herpesviruses, and vice versa for positive psychosocial factors (e.g. social support).The evidence identifies pathways linking psychosocial factors and immune response: co-viral infection and immune suppression, both of which are potentially relevant to TB and BCG response. However, the heterogeneity in the strength and nature of the impact of psychosocial factors on immune function, and lack of research on the implications of this relationship for TB, underscore the need for TB-specific research.",0

Background: The physical healthcare environment has significant effects on health and well-being. Research indicates that birthing environments can impact women during labor and birth. However, summaries of the effects of different environments around birth are scarce. Methods: We conducted a systematic review, searching 10 databases in 2016 and 2017 for published research from their inception dates, on how birthing room design influences maternal and neonate physical and emotional outcomes, using a protocol agreed a priori. The quality of selected studies was assessed, and data were extracted independently by pairs of authors and described in a narrative analysis. Results: In total, 3,373 records were identified and screened by title and abstract; 2,063 were excluded and the full text of 278 assessed for analysis. Another 241 were excluded, leaving 15 articles presenting qualitative and quantitative data from six different countries on four continents. The results of the analysis reveal four prominent physical themes in birthing rooms that positively influence on maternal and neonate physical and emotional outcomes: (1) means of distraction, comfort, and relaxation; (2) raising the birthing room temperature; (3) features of familiarity; and (4) diminishing a technocratic environment. Conclusions: The evidence on how birthing environments affect outcomes of labor and birth is incomplete. There is a crucial need for more research in this field.",0

This meta-analysis was conducted to investigate the association between sarcopenia and postoperative outcomes after urologic oncology surgery. Methods A systematic search in MEDLINE (via PubMed), Embase, Web of Science and Cochrane Library databases was conducted to identify the potential studies published before August 2019. Odds ratios and hazard ratios (HRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated through inverse variance with random or fixed effects models. Results Seventeen retrospective cohorts comprising 3,948 patients were included with sarcopenia prevalence between 25% and 68.9%. Patients with sarcopenia had significantly shorter overall survival (OS; HR = 2.06, 95% CI: 1.44–2.95; P Conclusions Sarcopenia is an independent poor prognostic factor for patients undergoing urologic oncology surgery, particularly postoperative risks of short survival and increased mortality. Thus, preoperative sarcopenia evaluation can provide clinicians with important information to guide and individualise patient management and improve surgical outcomes.",0

VR therapy may be an effective intervention for improving cognitive function following stroke. The aim of this systematic review was to examine the effectiveness of exercise-based VR therapy on cognition post-stroke.Electronic databases were searched for terms related to ""stroke"", ""virtual reality"", ""exercise"" and ""cognition"". Studies were included if they: (1) were randomized-controlled trials; (2) included VR-based interventions; (3) included individuals with stroke; and (4) included outcome measures related to cognitive function. Data from included studies were synthesised qualitatively and where possible, random effects meta-analyses were performed.Eight studies involving 196 participants were included in the review, of which five were included in meta-analyses (n = 124 participants). Studies varied in terms of type (combination of VR therapy and conventional therapy, combination of VR therapy and computer-based cognitive training, VR therapy alone) and duration of interventions (20-180 min), sample size (n = 12-42), length of the interventions (4-8 weeks), and cognitive outcomes examined. VR therapy was not more effective than control for improving global cognition (n = 5, SMD = 0.24, 95%CI:-0.30,0.78, p = .38), memory (n = 2 studies, SMD= 0.00, 95%CI: -0.58, 0.59, p = .99), attention (n = 2 studies, MD = 8.90, 95%CI: -27.89, 45.70, p = .64) or language (n = 2 studies, SMD = 0.56, 95%CI: -0.08,1.21, p = .09).VR therapy was not superior to control interventions in improving cognition in individuals with stroke. Future research should include high-quality and adequately powered trials examining the impact of virtual reality therapy on cognition post-stroke.Implications for rehabilitationVirtual reality therapy is a promising new form of technology that has been shown to increase patient satisfaction towards stroke rehabilitation.Virtual reality therapy has the added benefits of providing instant feedback, and the difficulty can be easily modified, underscoring the user-friendliness of this form of rehabilitation.Virtual reality therapy has the potential to improve various motor, cognitive and physical deficits following stroke, highlighting its usefulness in rehabilitation settings.",0

The VALUE trial found an increased risk of myocardial infarction in participants receiving ARBs compared to other antihypertensive. The aim of the meta-analysis was to synthetize the available evidence of randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and elucidate if ARBs increase the risk of cardiovascular events. Methods A comprehensive search was conducted to identify RCTs that assessed the safety of ARBs. Titles and abstracts of all papers were independently screened by two authors. Data extraction and quality assessment were also performed independently. The relative risk (RR) of all-cause mortality, myocardial infarction, and stroke were pooled using the IVhet model. Multiple sensitivity analyses were conducted to assess the effect of ARBs by restricting the analysis to different participants’ characteristics. Results Forty-five RCTs comprising of 170,794 participants were included in the analysis. The pooled estimates revealed that ARBs do not increase the risk of all-cause mortality (RR 1.00; 95%CI 0.97–1.04), myocardial infarction (RR 1.01; 95%CI 0.96–1.06), and stroke (RR 0.92; 95%CI 0.83–1.01). The sensitivity analysis did not yield a particular group of patients at increased risk of cardiovascular events with ARBs. Risk of all-cause mortality and stroke decreased with ARB when the proportion of smokers in a population was &lt; 25% (RR 0.91; 95%CI 0.84–0.98) and in females (RR 0.76; 95%CI 0.68–0.84), respectively.

A systematic review and meta-analysis protocol,"Abstract Background Water, sanitation, and hygiene interventions often fail to show long-term impact on diarrhoeal and/or intestinal parasite risk in many low- and middle-income countries. Less attention has been paid to wider contextual factors that may contribute to high levels of contamination in the domestic environment such as household flooring. The purpose of this study will be to assess the association between diarrhoeal and/or intestinal parasite infection status and unimproved/unfinished flooring in low- and middle-income countries. Methods We will conduct a comprehensive search of published studies (randomized controlled trials, non-randomized controlled trials, and observational studies) that examined the association between unimproved/unfinished household flooring and diarrhoeal and/or intestinal parasite infection status from January 1, 1980, onwards with no language restriction. The primary outcome will include diarrhoeal and/or intestinal parasite infection status. Databases to be searched include EMBASE, MEDLINE, Web of Science, and Google Scholar. The secondary outcome will be the association between specific pathogens (laboratory confirmed) and unimproved/unfinished household flooring. Independent screening for eligible studies using defined criteria and data extraction will be completed in duplicate and independently. Any discrepancies between the two reviewers will be resolved by consensus and/or arbitration by a third researcher. If data permits, random effects models will be used where appropriate. Subgroup and additional analyses will be conducted to explore the potential sources of heterogeneity (e.g. age group, geographical region) and potential risk of bias of included studies. Discussion This review will provide a comprehensive examination of a possible association between suboptimal household flooring and increased risk of enteric pathogen infection, highlight gaps for future research in high risk areas, and inform intervention design for future planned studies in Kenya and/or elsewhere in the region.

https://doi.org/10.1002/bjs5.50246,Prospective methods for identifying perioperative risk-assessment methods for patient safety over 20 years: a systematic review,"Abstract Background Serious preventable surgical events still occur despite considerable efforts to improve patient safety. In addition to learning from retrospective analyses, prospective risk-assessment methods may help to decrease preventable events further by targeting perioperative hazards. The aim of this systematic review was to assess the methods used to identify perioperative patient safety risks prospectively, and to describe the risk areas targeted, the quality characteristics and feasibility of methods. Methods MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL and Cochrane databases were searched, adhering to PRISMA guidelines. All studies describing the development and results of prospective methods to identify perioperative patient safety risks were included and assessed on methodological quality. Exclusion criteria were interventional studies, studies targeting one specific issue, studies reporting on structural factors relating to fundamental hospital items, and non-original or case studies. Results The electronic search resulted in 16 708 publications, but only 20 were included for final analysis, describing five prospective risk-assessment methods. Direct observation was used in most studies, often in combination. Direct (16 studies) and indirect (4 studies) observations identified (potential) adverse events (P)AEs, process flow disruptions, poor protocol compliance and poor practice performance. (Modified) Healthcare Failure Mode and Effect Analysis (HFMEA™) (5 studies) targeted potential process flow disruption failures, and direct (P)AE surveillance (3 studies) identified (P)AEs prospectively. Questionnaires (3 studies) identified poor protocol compliance, surgical flow disturbances and patients' willingness to ask questions about their care. Overall, quality characteristics and feasibility of the methods were poorly reported. Conclusion The direct (in-person) observation appears to be the primary prospective risk-assessment method that currently may best help to target perioperative hazards. This is a reliable method and covers a broad spectrum of perioperative risk areas.",0
https://doi.org/10.1136/oemed-2019-106311,Are workplace health promotion programmes effective for all socioeconomic groups? A systematic review,"Decreasing socioeconomic health inequalities is considered an important policy priority in many countries. Workplace health promotion programmes (WHPPs) have shown modest improvements in health behaviour. This systematic review aims to determine the presence and magnitude of socioeconomic differences in effectiveness and the influence of programme characteristics on differential effectiveness of WHPPs. Three electronic databases were searched for systematic reviews published from 2013 onwards and for original studies published from 2015 onwards. We synthesised the reported socioeconomic differences in effectiveness of WHPPs on health behaviours, and calculated effectiveness ratios by dividing the programme effects in the lowest socioeconomic group by the programme effects in the highest socioeconomic group. Thirteen studies with 75 comparisons provided information on the effectiveness of WHPPs across socioeconomic groups. Ten studies with 54 comparisons reported equal effectiveness and one study with 3 comparisons reported higher effectiveness for lower socioeconomic groups. Quantitative information on programme effects was available for six studies with 18 comparisons, of which 13 comparisons showed equal effectiveness and 5 comparisons showed significantly higher effect sizes among workers in low socioeconomic position. The differential effectiveness of WHPPs did not vary across programme characteristics. In this study no indications are found that WHPPs increase socioeconomic inequalities in health behaviour. The limited quantitative information available suggests that WHPPs may contribute to reducing socioeconomic inequalities. Better insight is needed on socioeconomic differences in effectiveness of WHPPs to develop strategies to decrease socioeconomic inequalities in health in the workforce.",0
https://doi.org/10.1007/s10143-019-01144-x,Efficacy and safety of gamma knife radiosurgery for posterior cranial fossa meningioma: a systematic review,"The management of posterior cranial fossa meningioma [PCFM] is challenging and many neurosurgeons advise gamma knife radiosurgery [GKRS] as a modality for its upfront or adjuvant treatment. Due to the varying radiosurgical response based on lesion location, tumor biology, and radiation dosage, we performed a pioneer attempt in doing a systematic review analyzing the treatment efficacy and safety profile of GKRS for PCFM based on current literature. A systematic review was performed according to Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses [PRISMA] guidelines. A thorough literature search was conducted on PubMed, Web of science, and Cochrane data base; articles were selected systematically based on PRISMA protocol, reviewed completely, and relevant data was summarized and discussed. A total of 18 publications pertaining to GKRS for PCFM were included with a pooled sample size of 2131 patients. The median pre-GKRS tumor volume ranged from 2.28 to 10.5 cm [3]. Primary GKRS was administered in 61.1% of the pooled study cohorts, adjuvant treatment in 32.9%, and salvage therapy in 6.5% patients. Majority of the meningiomas were WHO grade 1 tumors (99.7%). The pooled mean marginal dose in the studies was 13.6 Gy (range 12–15.2 Gy) while the mean of maximum doses was 28.6 Gy (range 25–35 Gy). Most studies report an excellent radiosurgical outcome including the tumor control rate and the progression-free survival [PFS] of over 90%. The tumor control, PFS, and adverse radiation effect [ARE] rates in author’s series were 92.3%, 91%, and 9.6%, respectively. The favorable radiosurgical outcome depends on multiple factors such as small tumor volume, absence of previous radiotherapy, tumor location, elderly patients, female gender, longer time from symptom onset, and decreasing maximal dose. GKRS as primary or adjuvant treatment modality needs to be considered as a promising management strategy for PCFM in selected patients in view of the growing evidence of high tumor control rate, improved neurological functions, and low incidence of ARE. The use of multiple isocenters, 3-D image planning, and limit GKRS treatment to tumors less than 3.5 cm help to avoid complications and achieve the best results. The treatment decisions in PCFM cases must be tailored and should consider the factors such as radiological profile, symptom severity, performance level, and patient preference for a good outcome.",0

We systematically searched the PubMed, Cochrane library and EMBASE databases from January 1, 1966 to March 1, 2019, to identify randomised controlled trials of PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors (nivolumab, pembrolizumab, atezolizumab, durvalumab and avelumab) that had available hazard ratios (HRs) for death according to PD-L1 status. A random-effects model was used to calculate the pooled overall survival (OS) HR and 95% CI among PD-L1-positive and PD-L1-negative patients. An interaction test was performed to evaluate the heterogeneity between the two estimates. A total of 24 randomised trials, involving 12,966 participants, fulfilled the inclusion criteria. An OS benefit of PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors was found in both PD-L1-positive patients (HR, 0.65; 95% CI, 0.60-0.70) and PD-L1-negative patients (HR, 0.82; 95% CI, 0.74-0.91) even at the minimum cut-off value of 1%. Significant differences in the efficacy of PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors between PD-L1-positive and PD-L1-negative patients were noted at different cut-off values. Moreover, there was a positive dose-response relationship between PD-L1 positivity and OS benefit (HR for 1%, 0.58, [0.50, 0.67]; 5%, 0.52 [0.43, 0.64]; 10%, 0.50 [0.40, 0.63]). Subgroup analyses showed that these results were generally consistent, regardless of study design, line of treatment, treatment type, tumour type, PD-L1 staining cell type and median follow-up time. We demonstrated that PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors significantly improved OS in both PD-L1 positive and PD-L1 negative patients compared to controls, but the magnitude of benefit was clinically PD-L1-dependent.",0

This study aimed to examine the effectiveness of multifactorial fall prevention interventions among community-dwelling older adults and compare subgroups that differed in terms of their degree of fall risk and the intensity and components of interventions. An exhaustive systematic literature search was undertaken using the following databases: Ovid-Medline, Ovid-Embase, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (Central). Two investigators independently extracted data and assessed the quality of the studies by examining the risk of bias. We conducted a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials that had been published up to March 31st, 2019, using Review Manager. Of 1,328 studies, 45 articles were relevant to this study. In total, 29 studies included participants in the high-risk group, 3 in the frail group, and 13 in the healthy older adult group. Additionally, 28 and 17 studies used active and referral multifactorial interventions, respectively. Multifactorial interventions included the following components: exercise, education, environmental modification, medication, mobility aids, and vision and psychological management. Multifactorial interventions significantly reduced fall rates in the high-risk (risk ratio 0.66; 95% confidence interval 0.52–0.84) and healthy groups (risk ratio 0.72; 95% confidence interval 0.58–0.89), when compared to the control group. Active multifactorial interventions (risk ratio 0.64; 95% confidence interval 0.51–0.80) and those featuring exercise (risk ratio 0.66; 95% confidence interval 0.54–0.80) and environmental modification also showed significantly reduced fall rates (risk ratio 0.65; 95% confidence interval 0.54–0.79) compared to usual care. Multifactorial interventions had a significantly lower number of people who experienced falls during the study period compared to usual care in the healthy group (risk ratio 0.77; 95% confidence interval 0.62–0.95). Active multifactorial interventions (risk ratio 0.73; 95% confidence interval 0.60–0.89) and those featuring exercise (risk ratio 0.79; 95% confidence interval 0.66–0.95) and environmental modification (risk ratio 0.80; 95% confidence interval 0.68–0.95) had a significantly lower number of people who experienced falls compared to those receiving usual care. Active multifactorial interventions had positive effects on fall rates and the number of people experiencing falls. Thus, healthcare workers, including nurses, should be involved in planning fall prevention programs so that older adults can be provided with optimal care; multifactorial interventions that include exercise and environmental modification are particularly effective in reducing falls.",0

Therefore, we planned to systematically and quantitatively investigate the overall strength of proofs in this field. Methods Relevant articles on Cochrane, EMBASE, Medline, Web of Science, and CINHAL were searched as per relevant strategies. Only observational studies that disclosed the link of CKD risk with major air pollutants were enrolled, including PM10 and PM2.5, which were particulate matter less than 10 um and less than 2.5 um in erodynamic diameter respectively. Pooled relative risk (RR) and 95 % confidence interval (CI) were determined using random--effects models, regardless of the heterogeneity quantified by I2 statistic. Results Finally, 7 studies involving 5,812,381 participants were included. The incidence of CKD was increased by long-term exposure to PM10 (including solely estimated exposure to PM10 from studies using PM2.5) (RR 1.08, 95 %CI 1.04–1.11) with considerable heterogeneity (I2 = 79 %), and the risk of CKD was raised by 8% when the long-time exposure to PM10 increased by 10 ug/m3. The pooled RR (95 %CI) with a 10 μg/m3 increase in PM2.5 for risk of CKD was 1.09 (1.03–1.17). Stratified analysis also verified the general negative effects. Conclusions Chronic subjection to major air contaminants (PM10 and PM2.5) is more likely to cause CKD. Thus, developing global approaches of air pollution elimination to prevent CKD is urgent.",1

Immune checkpoint inhibitors have emerged as treatments for many cancers. Data are lacking regarding efficacy and rejection risk in the SOT population. We conducted a systematic literature review and analyzed 83 cases of immune checkpoint inhibitor use for cancer in SOT. Two thirds of these patients received anti–programmed death ligand 1 therapy, 15.7% received anti–cytotoxic T lymphocyte–associated protein 4 therapy, and 10.8% received a combination. Allograft rejection occurred in 39.8% of patients, leading to end-stage organ failure in 71.0% of cases. Outcomes were similar across organs and immunotherapy regimens. The use of immunosuppressants other than steroids, time since transplant, and prior episodes of rejection were associated with the risk of rejection. The median overall survival of patients was 36 weeks. Most of the deaths were related to cancer progression. In nonkidney recipients, graft rejection was strongly associated with worse survival. At the end of the study, 19.3% of the patients were alive, free from rejection and tumor progression. This study highlights the difficult tradeoff facing oncologists and transplant specialists managing transplant recipients with cancer, and the need for prospective data and novel biomarkers for identifying the patients likely to benefit from immunotherapy in the SOT setting.",0

To verify what types of interventions to manage occupational stress and burn out within neonatal intensive care units (NICUs) have been introduced so far and to verify their efficacy among caregivers. PsycINFO (PsycINFO 1967–July week 3 2019), Embase (Embase 1996–2019 week 29) e Medline (Ovid MEDLINE(R) without revisions 1996–July week 2 2019) were systematically searched combining MeSH and free text terms for “burn out” AND “healthcare provider” AND “NICU”. Inclusion criteria were interventions directed to healthcare providers settled in NICUs. Only English language papers were included. Six articles were included in the final analysis. All the studies reported an overall efficacy of the interventions in reducing work-related stress, both when individual focused and organisation directed. The analysis revealed low quality of the studies and high heterogeneity in terms of study design, included populations, interventions and their evaluation assessment. There is currently very limited evidence regarding the management of occupational stress and burn out within NICUs. The quality of available studies was suboptimal. The peculiarities of the NICUs should be considered when developing strategies for occupational stress management. Training self-awareness of workers regarding their reactions to the NICU environment, also from the pre-employment stage, could be an additional approach to prevent and manage stress.",0

Current WHO recommendations suggest transitioning to dolutegravir-based (adults) or raltegravir-based-regimens (neonates) for initial antiretroviral therapy (ART) and as a suitable alternative in cases of multi-resistance in resource-limited settings. This review aims at synthesizing the current knowledge on dolutegravir use and integrase resistance-associated mutations found before the wide use of dolutegravir-based regimens. Methods This systematic review will include randomized and non-randomized trials, cohort, and cross-sectional studies published on dolutegravir use or integrase resistance-associated mutations in Sub-Saharan Africa. Searches will be conducted (from 2007 onwards) in PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), Latin American and Caribbean Health Sciences Literature (LILAC), Web of Science, African Journals Online, and Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL) databases. Hand searching of the reference lists of relevant reviews and trials will be conducted and we will also look for conference abstracts. We will include studies of adults and/or children exposed to integrase inhibitors-based therapies; especially dolutegravir or raltegravir (which is our intervention of interest as compared to other antiretroviral regimens). We will exclude studies of patients with specific co-morbidities such as tuberculosis or opportunistic infections. Primary outcomes will be “the rate of viral suppression” and “the level of drug resistance” on integrase inhibitor-based regimens among patients in Sub-Saharan Africa. Secondary outcomes will be “the effect of baseline viremia on viral suppression,” “the effect of treatment duration on viral suppression,” “the proportion of patients with immune recovery,” “the rate of non-adherence,” “rate of adverse events;” “drug resistance according to different integrase inhibitor-based regimens,” and “drug resistance according to viral subtypes/recombinants.” Two reviewers will independently screen titles and abstracts, assess the full texts for eligibility, and extract data. If data permits, random effects models will be used where appropriate. Subgroup and additional analyses will be conducted to explore the potential sources of heterogeneity (e.g., age, sex, baseline viremia, CD4 following treatment, treatment duration, and adherence level). Discussion This review will help to strengthen evidence on the effectiveness of integrase strand transfer inhibitors by contributing to current knowledge on the use of dolutegravir and/or raltegravir (especially for neonates) in Sub-Saharan Africa. Results will therefore help in setting-up baseline data for an optimal management of people living with HIV as Sub-Saharan African countries are transitioning to dolutegravir-based regimens. Evidence will also support HIV/AIDS programs in identifying gaps and actions to be undertaken for improved long-term care and treatment of people living with HIV in Sub-Saharan Africa.

A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis,"Background: Current evidence of the influence of the medication regimen complexity (MRC) on the patients’ clinical outcomes are not conclusive. Objective: To systematically and analytically assess the association between MRC measured by the Medication Regimen Complexity Index (MRCI) and clinical outcomes. Methods: A search was carried out in the databases Cochrane Library, LILACS, PubMed, Scopus, EMBASE, Open Thesis, and Web of Science to identify studies evaluating the association between MRC and clinical outcomes that were published from January 1, 2004, to April 2, 2018. The search terms included outcome assessment, drug therapy, and medication regimen complexity index and their synonyms in different combinations for case-control and cohort studies that used the MRCI to measure MRC and related the MRCI with clinical outcomes. Odds ratios (ORs), hazard ratios (HRs), and mean differences (WMDs) were calculated, and heterogeneity was assessed using the I 2 test. Results: A total of 12 studies met the eligibility criteria. The meta-analysis showed that MRC is associated with the following clinical outcomes: hospitalization (HR = 1.20; 95% CI = 1.14 to 1.27; I 2 = 0%) in cohort studies, hospital readmissions (WMD = 7.72; 95% CI = 1.19 to 14.25; I 2 = 84%) in case-control studies, and medication nonadherence (adjusted OR = 1.05; 95% CI = 1.02 to 1.07; I 2 = 0%) in cohort studies. Conclusion and Relevance: This systematic review and meta-analysis gathered relevant scientific evidence and quantified the combined estimates to show the association of MRC with clinical outcomes: hospitalization, hospital readmission, and medication adherence.",0
https://doi.org/10.1177/0964528420920299,Non-specific effects of acupuncture and sham acupuncture in clinical trials from the patient’s perspective: a systematic review of qualitative evidence,"Background Previous clinical trials have demonstrated that both acupuncture and sham acupuncture exert significant, non-specific effects on treatment outcomes when compared to no-treatment controls. A recently developed framework (mechanisms in orthodox and complementary and alternative medicine—MOCAM) suggests that the non-specific effects of acupuncture originate from multiple domains (e.g. patient characteristics, acupuncturist skill/technique, the patient–acupuncturist relationship, and the acupuncture environment). However, it remains to be determined precisely how these domains influence the non-specific effects of treatment among patients receiving acupuncture and sham acupuncture in clinical trials. Therefore, we conducted a systematic review to synthesize existing qualitative evidence on how trial participants randomized to acupuncture and sham acupuncture groups experience non-specific effects, regardless of the types of medical condition investigated. Methods This systematic review included primary qualitative studies embedded in randomized controlled trials designed to investigate acupuncture or sham acupuncture interventions. Eligible studies published in English were derived from a search of five international databases. The methodological quality of included studies was evaluated using the Critical Appraisal Skills Programme (CASP) tool. Using a framework synthesis approach, the identified MOCAM framework was adapted based on the synthesis of the available qualitative evidence. Results A total of 20 studies of high methodological quality were included. Our proposed model indicated that the effects of acupuncture may be increased by maintaining a professional status, applying a holistic treatment approach, practicing empathy, and providing patients with an appropriate explanation of the theory behind acupuncture and sham acupuncture. From the patient’s perspective, the efficacy of treatment can be increased by following the lifestyle modification advice provided by acupuncturists, maintaining a positive attitude toward treatment efficacy, actively engaging with acupuncturists during consultation, and making behavioral changes based on experience gained during the trial. Conclusion The results of this study may provide a basis for improving and standardizing key components of non-specific effects in acupuncture treatment, and for improving the isolation of specific effects in future clinical trials involving acupuncture and sham acupuncture.",0
https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jvs.2019.10.084,A systematic review of penetrating extracranial vertebral artery injuries,"<h2>Abstract</h2><h3>Background</h3> Penetrating vertebral artery injuries (VAIs) are rare. Because of their rarity, complex anatomy, and difficult surgical exposures, few surgeons and trauma centers have developed significant experience with their management. The objectives of this study were to review their incidence, clinical presentation, radiologic identification, management, complications, and outcomes and to provide a review of anatomic exposures and surgical techniques for their management. <h3>Methods</h3> A literature search on MEDLINE Complete-PubMed, Cochrane, Ovid, and Embase for the period of 1893 to 2018 was conducted. Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines were used. Our literature search yielded a total of 181 potentially eligible articles with 71 confirmed articles, consisting of 21 penetrating neck injury series, 13 VAI-specific series, and 37 case reports. Operative procedures and outcomes were recorded along with methods of angiographic imaging and operative management. All articles were reviewed by at least two independent authors, and data were analyzed collectively. <h3>Results</h3> There were a total of 462 patients with penetrating VAIs. The incidence of VAI in the civilian population was 3.1% vs 0.3% in the military population. More complete data were available from 13 collected VAI-specific series and 37 case reports for a total of 362 patients. Mechanism of injury data were available for 341 patients (94.2%). There were gunshot wounds (178 patients [49.2%]), stab wounds (131 [73.6%]), and miscellaneous mechanisms of injury (32 [8.8%]). Anatomic site of injury data were available for 177 (49%) patients: 92 (25.4%) left, 84 (23.2%) right, and 1 (0.3%) bilateral. Anatomic segment of injury data were available for 204 patients (56.4%): 28 (7.7%) V1, 125 (34.5%) V2, and 51 (14.1%) V3. Treatment data were available for 212 patients. Computed tomography angiography was the most common imaging modality (163 patients [77%]). Injuries were addressed by operative management (94 [44.3%]), angiography and angioembolization (72 [34%]), combined approaches (11 [5.2%]), and observation (58 [27.4%]). Stenting and repair were less frequently employed (10 [4.7%]). The incidence of aneurysms or pseudoaneurysms was 18.5% (67); the incidence of arteriovenous fistula was 16.9% (61). The calculated mortality in VAI-specific series was 15.1%; in the individual case report group, it was 10.5%. <h3>Conclusions</h3> The majority of VAIs present without neurologic symptoms, although some may present with exsanguinating hemorrhage. Computed tomography angiography should be considered first line to establish diagnosis. Gunshot wounds account for most injuries. The most frequently injured segment is V2. Surgical ligation is the most common intervention, followed by angioembolization, both of which constitute important management approaches.",0

A random-effects meta-analysis was used to estimate the hazard ratio (HR) and its 95% confidence interval (CI). Sensitivity analysis was performed using a fixed-effect model. The I2 statistic was used to evaluate the heterogeneity of the study data.Six randomized controlled trials, comprising 43352 participants (13491 with and 29861 without DM) who had received antiplatelet therapy for ≥ 3 mo, were included in the meta-analysis. Compared with aspirin alone, a combination of clopidogrel and aspirin significantly reduced the risk of any cardiovascular event in patients without DM (HR = 0.78, 95%CI: 0.71-0.86, P < 0.001; I2 = 23%, P = 0.26). Clopidogrel plus aspirin also significantly reduced cardiovascular risk in patients with DM, although the effect was smaller (HR = 0.89, 95%CI: 0.81-0.99, P = 0.030; I2 = 0%, P = 0.74). Nevertheless, there was no significant difference in the efficacy of clopidogrel at reducing the risk of cardiovascular events in patients with DM vs those without (P for interaction = 0.062).Thus, the present study shows that the addition of clopidogrel to aspirin significantly lowers cardiovascular risk in patients with or without DM who have experienced ischemic cardiovascular disease. The beneficial effect of the addition of clopidogrel to aspirin for patients with DM was lower than that in patients without DM, although the modifying effect of DM did not reach significance.",0

Because severe toxicities have been documented after radiation therapy for MPM, its use remains controversial, especially as modern surgical management has shifted toward lung-sparing pleurectomy/decortication. IMRT is an advanced technique that may allow for safer radiation therapy delivery, but there remains limited data (including no summative data) to support this notion. Methods and Materials We performed a systematic review evaluating the safety and efficacy of post-pleurectomy IMRT (P-IMRT). A systematic review of PubMed using Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines was conducted for publications of all dates that specifically reported clinical outcomes and/or toxicities of P-IMRT in patients with MPM. Ten original studies were included in this review. Results The incidence of grade 3 pneumonitis ranged from 0% to 16%, with all but 2 studies reporting rates below 9%. Grade 4 and 5 pneumonitis were observed in less than 1.5% of cases, except in one publication that used hypofractionated radiation therapy to doses >60 Gy. Crude local failure rates ranged from 19% to 60%, median progression free survival ranged from 12 to 16 months, and median overall survival ranged from 19 to 28 months. Conclusions P-IMRT produces relatively few higher-grade toxicities and has reasonable disease-related outcomes, especially when delivered using conventionally fractionated regimens to doses of 45 to 54 Gy and exercising careful attention to dose constraints during treatment planning. IMRT can thus be considered in well-selected patients in whom adequate survival after pleurectomy is expected. These data also support the initiation of the phase III NRG-LU006 trial of extended pleurectomy/decortication and chemotherapy with or without IMRT.",0

Dose-dense chemotherapy, which is adopted as adjuvant chemotherapy of high-risk breast cancer, is addressed in the Japanese Breast Cancer Society Clinical Practice Guideline for breast cancer, 2018 edition (in Japanese). To evaluate the benefits and safety of dose-dense adjuvant chemotherapy described in the guideline, we performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of data of randomized trials using the same drugs, doses, and numbers of cycles. The PubMed, Cochrane Library, and Ichushi-Web databases were searched for relevant publications reporting randomized trials published until November 2016. Overall survival (OS), disease-free survival (DFS), and toxicity were assessed. Three trials comprising 5190 patients were included. Compared with conventional chemotherapy, dose-dense chemotherapy lengthened OS (RR = 0.76; 95% CI = 0.64–0.90) and DFS (RR = 0.83; 95% CI = 0.75–0.92) and increased the risk of anemia (RR = 4.56; 95% CI = 2.01–10.34). We conclude that dose-dense chemotherapy can be highly recommended as adjuvant chemotherapy for patients with breast cancer with a high risk of recurrence risk and sufficient bone marrow function.",0

MMP-14 exhibits different expression in patients with various cancers, suggesting that it may be considered as a potential prognostic biomarker for cancer. Methods Therefore, this meta-analysis was performed to elucidate the prognostic value and association of MMP-14 over-expression in several types of cancers. Eligible studies based on eligibility criteria from various online databases were searched. The pooled hazard ratios (HRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for overall survival (OS) were analyzed to determine the prognostic value of MMP-14 using STATA software 12.0. Results We identified sixteen applicable studies in this meta-analysis comprising 2,766 samples. Over-expression MMP-14 was significantly correlated with a poor overall survival (OS) outcome in multiple cancers (HR: 2.22; 95% CI: 1.72 - 2.87). Moreover, high levels of MMP-14 were markedly associated with tumor progression and metastasis (HR: 1.83; 95% CI: 1.36 - 2.46). MMP-14 expression was also associated with histological differentiation (OR: 0.37; 95% CI: 0.18 - 0.77). Conclusions MMP-14 over-expression suggested aggressive biological behaviors and implied that MMP-14 may be a useful prognostic biomarker in human cancers.",0

https://doi.org/10.1111/jhn.12758,Front of pack nutritional labelling schemes: a systematic review and meta‐analysis of recent evidence relating to objectively measured consumption and purchasing,"BACKGROUND: Front of pack labelling (FOPL) provides visible nutritional information and appears to influence knowledge and reformulation. However, a recent Cochrane review found limited and inconsistent evidence for behaviour change. The present review aimed to examine studies published subsequent the Cochrane review, focusing on prepackaged foods, examining the impact of FOPL on purchasing and consumption. METHODS: Controlled experimental/intervention and interrupted time series (ITS) studies were included, with no age/geography restrictions. Exposures were FOPL with objectively measured consumption/purchasing outcomes. Thirteen databases were searched (January 2017 to April 2019) and forward citation searching was undertaken on the included studies. Purchasing data from experimental studies were meta-analysed. Two series of meta-analyses were undertaken; combined FOPL versus no-FOPL and specific FOPL scheme versus no-FOPL. Outcomes were sugar (g 100 g-1 ), calories (kcal 100 g-1 ), saturated fat (g 100 g-1 ) and sodium (mg 100 g-1 ). RESULTS: We identified 14 studies, reporting consumption (experimental; n = 3) and purchasing (n = 8, experimental; n = 3, ITS). Meta-analysis of experimental studies showed sugar and sodium content of purchases was lower for combined FOPL versus no-FOPL (-0.40 g sugar 100 g-1 , P < 0.01; -24.482 mg sodium 100 g-1 , P = 0.012), with a trend for lower energy and saturated fat (-2.03 kcal 100 g-1 , P = 0.08; -0.154 g saturated fat 100 g-1 , P = 0.091). For specific FOPL, products purchased by 'high in' FOPL groups had lower sugar (-0.67 g sugar 100 g-1 , P ≤ 0.01), calories (-4.43 kcal 100 g-1 , P < 0.05), sodium (-33.78 mg 100 g-1 , P = 0.01) versus no-FOPL; Multiple Traffic Light had lower sodium (-34.94 mg 100 g-1 , P < 0.01) versus no-FOPL. Findings regarding consumption were limited and inconsistent. FOPL resulted in healthier purchasing in ITS studies. CONCLUSIONS: This review provides evidence from experimental and 'real-life' studies indicating that FOPL encourages healthier food purchasing. PROSPERO CRD42019135743.",0

Methods We performed a systematic review of relevant reports from randomized-controlled studies published prior to November 2016 found using medical journal search engines. The main outcomes which we evaluated were progression-free survival (PFS), objective response rate (ORR), disease control rate (CBR), and toxicity. Results Four controlled trials comparing aromatase inhibitors (AI) and cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK)4/6 inhibitor combination therapy to AI monotherapy, and two controlled trials comparing anastrozole to fulvestrant 500 mg were analyzed. AI/CDK4/6 inhibitor combination therapy significantly improved PFS (Risk Ratio: 0.67, 95%CI 0.60–0.73), increased ORR (Risk Difference: 0.11, 95% CI 0.07–0.16), and increased CBR (Risk Difference: 0.11, 95% CI 0.07–0.15), compared with AI monotherapy. Patients who received this combination therapy had a higher grade ≥ 3 adverse event rate more than those who received AI monotherapy (Risk Difference: 43%, 95%CI: 0.39–0.47). Fulvestrant 500 mg alone significantly improved PFS (risk ratio: 0.85, 95%CI 0.72–0.98), but ORR and CBR were similar to those of anastrozole alone. Conclusion In the first-line treatment for advanced postmenopausal hormone receptor-positive breast cancer, a combination therapy of CDK4/6 inhibitors and AI showed significant improvement of PFS, ORR, and CBR but with significant increased toxicities compared with AI alone. Fulvestrant 500 mg monotherapy significantly prolonged PFS compared with AI monotherapy. We must wait for the results of the studies with longer follow-up period.",0

This review was conducted according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses guidelines. PubMed, EMBASE and Web of Science databases were searched up to May 30th, 2019 for bioheat transfer models focusing on direct contact between skin and temperature (heat and/or cold) source. Ten studies were included. A 16-item checklist was used to assess their methodological quality. Four studies analyzed healthy skin and six included pathological conditions. All determined skin’s thermal behavior, and studies including pathological conditions also analyzed burn damage. Studies did not present a wide variety of mathematical formulation, emphasizing on modelling equations of well-established models from the literature, such as the Pennes’ bioheat transfer equation, and the Henriques and Moritz model to quantify skin damage. Reporting of modelling characteristics and formulation of the computational models is not standardized and there is shortage of implementation of validation procedures, hindering representative conclusions. The lack of validation procedures led to low methodological quality. However, all studies provided strategies and parameters as starting points for future developments in this research area.",0
https://doi.org/10.4088/jcp.19r12965,"Long-Term Effects of Intrauterine Exposure to Antidepressants on Physical, Neurodevelopmental, and Psychiatric Outcomes:","Reviews on child outcomes following in utero antidepressant exposure have focused on short-term outcomes. However, several recent individual studies reported on adverse physical, neurodevelopmental, and psychiatric outcomes beyond infancy and early childhood. The objective of this systematic review was to establish the long-term effects of prenatal antidepressant exposure on physical, neurodevelopmental, and psychiatric outcomes in individuals aged 4 years and older.Embase, MEDLINE Ovid, Web of Science, Cochrane Central, and Google Scholar were systematically searched for all relevant articles, written in English and published prior to November 8, 2018, using terms describing antidepressants, pregnancy, and developmental outcomes.All original research articles on long-term outcomes of prenatal antidepressant exposure were eligible for inclusion. After screening and removal of duplicates, a total of 34 studies were identified.Included articles were qualitatively analyzed to determine inconsistency, indirectness, imprecision, and study bias.The identified studies demonstrated statistically significant associations between prenatal antidepressant exposure and a range of physical, neurodevelopmental, and psychiatric outcomes. Yet, the risk of confounding by indication was high. When controlling for confounders, 5 studies investigating physical outcomes (asthma, cancer, body mass index [BMI], epilepsy) found no association except conflicting outcomes for BMI. Eighteen studies examining neurodevelopmental outcomes (cognition, behavior, IQ, motor development, speech, language, and scholastic outcomes) found no consistent associations with antidepressant exposure after taking confounders into account. Eleven studies investigated psychiatric outcomes. After adjusting for confounders, prenatal antidepressant exposure was associated with affective disorders but not with childhood psychiatric outcomes (eg, autism spectrum disorders, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder).Reported associations between in utero exposure to antidepressants and physical, neurodevelopmental, and psychiatric outcomes, in large part, seem to be driven by the underlying maternal disorder. When limiting confounding by indication, prenatal exposure to antidepressants was significantly associated only with offspring BMI and affective disorders.",0

The systematic review of the literature identified 47 patients with secondary adenocarcinoma in a colonic urinary diversion not exposed to the fecal stream. The diagnosis of secondary adenocarcinoma was determined due to the presence major local symptoms and because the cancer in half of the patients was detected at an advanced stage. Diagnosis at an earlier stage was associated with long-term cancer-free survival. The authors concluded that cystoscopy-colonoscopy screening as suggested by the American Gastroenterology Society for the general population should be applied to patients who have colon urinary diversion not exposed to the fecal stream. For patients with active high-grade inflammation, difficulty with self-catheterization, or symptoms, cystoscopy should be performed earlier. Resection of the tumor at an early stage offers better clinical outcomes with longer survival rates.",0
https://doi.org/10.1007/s12253-019-00632-1,Prognostic Differences in ISUP Grade Group 4: a Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis,"The ISUP (Internal Society of Urologic Pathology) recently adopted a five-tiered prognostication system. There is evidence to suggest that the ISUP grade group 4 is a heterogeneous entity regarding prognosis. Our aim was to systematically examine the existing evidence to determine if outcome differences exist within the ISUP grade group 4. A systematic search of the literature for all studies examining the heterogeneity of the ISUP grade group 4 was conducted. Available studies were combined with meta-analysis to evaluate prognostic differences within the ISUP grade group 4 measured by all-cause mortality (ACM) and the prostate cancer-specific mortality (PCSM). Eight studies were identified and utilised a variety of outcome measures to answer the question of heterogeneity within the ISUP grade group 4. Four of these studies examined prognosis using both ACM and PCSM. These were combined into a meta-analysis. The combined group of 5 + 3/3 + 5 had statistically significant higher ACM (hazard ratio [HR] 1.23, 95% confidence internal [Cl] 1.08–1.41) when compared to the 4 + 4 group. There was no difference in the PCSM between the two groups (HR 1.34, 95% CI 0.89–2.01). However, heterogeneity was high for this analysis secondary to a range of methodological differences. Our meta-analysis showed that Gleason grade 3 + 5/5 + 3 had higher ACM than Gleason grade group 4 + 4. Measures of PCSM were statistically insignificant, although heterogeneity was high. Evidence suggests that heterogeneity is likely, although inconclusive. Further studies with consistent methodologies are required to answer this question.",0
,[Safety of cell salvage in tumor surgery : Systematic review with meta-analysis],"Background Allogeneic blood transfusion is avoidable in many oncological interventions by the use of cell salvage or mechanical autotransfusion (MAT). As irradiation is elaborate and expensive, the safety of leucocyte depletion filters (LDF) for autologous blood from the surgical field might be a more acceptable alternative for the prevention of cancer recurrences. A previous meta-analysis could not identify an increased risk of cancer recurrence. The aim of this review article is to provide an update of a previous meta-analysis from 2012 as well as a safety analysis of cell salvage with LDF due to the improved data situation. Material and methods This systematic review included all studies in PubMed, Cochrane, Cochrane Reviews and Web of Science on cell salvage or autotransfusion combined with outcomes, e.g. cancer recurrence, mortality, survival, blood transfusion, length of hospital stay (LOS) after the use of MAT without irradiation and with or without LDF. The grades of recommendations (GRADE) assessment of underlying evidence was applied. Results A total of seven new observational studies and seven meta-analyses were found that compared unfiltered or filtered cell salvage with autologous predeposition, allogeneic transfusion or without any transfusion. No randomized controlled trials have been completed. A total of 27 observational and cohort studies were included in a meta-analysis. The evidence level was low. The risk of cancer recurrence in recipients of autologous salvaged blood with or without LDF was reduced (odds ratio, OR 0.71, 95% confidence interval, CI 0.58-0.86) as compared to non-transfused subjects, allogeneic or predeposited autologous transfusion. The transfusion rate could not be assessed due to the substantial selection bias and large heterogeneity. Cell salvage does not change mortality and LOS. Leucocyte depletion studies reported a removal rate of cancer cells in the range of 99.6-99.9%. Conclusion Randomized controlled trials on a comparison of MAT and allogeneic blood transfusion as well as LDF and irradiation would be desirable but are not available. From observational trials and more than 6300 subjects and various tumors, cell salvage in cancer surgery with or without LDF appears to be sufficiently safe. The efficacy of leucocyte depletion of autologous salvaged blood is equivalent to irradiation. Unavailability of radiation is not a contraindication for cell salvage use in cancer surgery. By usage of leucocyte depleted salvaged autologous blood, the risks of allogeneic transfusion can be avoided.",0
https://doi.org/10.1186/s13643-020-01330-9,"Association between pesticide exposure and paraoxonase-1 (PON1) polymorphisms, and neurobehavioural outcomes in children: a systematic review","Abstract Environmental factors such as pollution, pesticide exposure and socio-demographic location have been implicated as a pressure capable of altering genetic make-up. Altered genetic sequence of genes encoding enzymes may result in single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP). Of peculiar interest is the genetic variance on the paraoxonase-1 gene induced by pre- and postnatal exposure to pesticides. SNP have been reported on the paraoxonase-1 gene and post-xenobiotic exposure and are presumed to alter gene sequence and ultimately enzymatic activity. The altered enzymatic activity may facilitate neurodevelopment disorders. Autism spectrum disorders (ASD) and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) are among the neurodevelopment disorders of which prevalence is concurrently associated with increasing environmental xenobiotic exposure. The variance on xenobiotic metabolising genes is associated with altered neurodevelopment outcome and ultimately altered neurobehavioural outcome. Prime interests of this systematic review were to establish an understanding of the sequences on the paraoxonase-1 gene associated with adverse neurobehavioural outcome. An in-depth literature search was conducted using the term combination “pesticide exposure, pre- and postnatal exposure, organophosphates/organophosphorus, single nucleotide polymorphism, paraoxonase-1 (PON-1), neurodevelopment/neurobehavioural outcome in child/infant”. Articles published from the year 2000 to 2018 were considered for review. The result showed that variance on the PON1-108 and 192 alleles could be implicated in the development of altered neurobehavioural outcomes.",1

Objective To conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis comparing overall and prostate cancer–specific mortality (OM and PCM) among patients with high-risk prostate cancer treated with RP or RT/ADT. Evidence acquisition We searched PubMed, Scopus, and the Cochrane Library through July 2019 covering a period since 2009. We report the results of our systematic search according to recommendations from the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses statement. Adjusted hazard ratios (aHRs) were extracted for each endpoint. The risk of bias was assessed using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale. Evidence synthesis A total of 23 studies with low to moderate risk of bias were found to meet the inclusion criteria. In keeping with prior studies, external beam radiation therapy (XRT) without specification of ADT was associated with worse OM and PCM (aHR 1.65, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.42–1.91, p  Conclusions Evidence demonstrating definitive superiority of either modality is lacking. Recent studies show improved consideration of ADT, radiation dose, brachytherapy boost, and utilization of postoperative adjuvant radiation. Residual confounding continues to limit the interpretation of observational data. Patient summary In the treatment of high-risk prostate cancer, many observational studies reporting higher mortality for radiotherapy demonstrate potential for confounding. More recent studies with current standard of care radiation regimens using androgen deprivation therapy or brachytherapy boost demonstrate approaching equivalence of prostatectomy and radiation modalities. Prospective randomized trials are needed to confirm these findings.",0

A random effect meta-analysis of children's pre-operative anxiety was performed.Eight studies with a total of 722 patients were included in the analysis. The effectiveness of web-based mobile health interventions, including age-appropriate videos, web-based game apps, and educational preparation games made for the hospital environment, was examined in pre-operative settings. A meta-analysis (N = 560 children) based on six studies found a statistically significant reduction in pre-operative anxiety measured by the Modified Yale Pre-operative Anxiety Scale with a moderate effect size. Three studies reported parental satisfaction.Web-based mobile health interventions can reduce children's pre-operative anxiety and increase parental satisfaction. Web-based mobile health interventions could be considered as non-pharmacological distraction tools for children in nursing. There is not enough evidence regarding the effectiveness of reducing children's postoperative pain and parental anxiety using similar interventions.Web-based mobile health interventions reduce children´s pre-operative anxiety and could therefore be considered as non-pharmacological distraction tools for children in nursing.",0

In this meta-analysis of existing longitudinal studies, the hypothesis that lower pulmonary function and respiratory illness are linked to an elevated risk of dementia was tested. <h3>Methods</h3> A systematic review was conducted of longitudinal studies using PubMed until April 1, 2019, and, where possible, results were pooled in random effects meta-analyses. <h3>Results</h3> Ten studies relating pulmonary function to later dementia risk and 11 studies of respiratory illness and dementia (including one that assessed both factors) were identified. The lowest quartile of FEV<sub>1</sub> compared with the highest was associated with a 1.4-fold (hazard ratio [HR], 1.46; 95% CI, 0.77-2.75) increased dementia risk (N<sub>total</sub> = 62,209; two studies). A decrease of 1 SD in FEV<sub>1</sub> was associated with a 28% increase in dementia risk (HR, 1.28; 95% CI, 1.03-1.60; N<sub>total</sub> = 67,505; six studies). Respiratory illness was also associated with increased dementia risk to a similar degree (pooled HR, 1.54; 95% CI, 1.30-1.81; N<sub>total</sub> = 288,641; 11 studies). <h3>Conclusions</h3> Individuals with poor pulmonary function experience an increased risk of dementia. The extent to which the association between poor pulmonary function and dementia is causal remains unclear and requires examination.",0

Inclusion criteria were randomized controlled trials (RCTs) published between January 1988 and December 2019, with at least 6 months of follow-up, comparing the clinical and radiographic success rates of two or more DPC agents applied in primary teeth with cariously and non-cariously exposed pulp.Initial searches identified 83 potentially relevant studies on DPC in primary teeth. Sixty-four of these studies were excluded, whereas 19 articles satisfied the inclusion criteria and were retrieved in full text for data extraction and a methodological quality assessment. Finally, 12 of these articles were included in the systematic review. Low and moderate risks of bias were observed. Overall, DPC clinical and radiographic success rates among the selected studies ranged between 53% and 100%.For DPC in primary teeth, this systematic review found that diverse new biologically and compatible agents with promising success rates are currently available for paediatric dentistry practitioners. There is no evidence that justifies discarding the judicious use of DPC procedures in primary teeth.",0

Methods We ran an extended search in MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, Engineering Village and Web of Science. Diagnostic test studies, experimental breast phantom studies and a Monte Carlo phantom study were included. A narrative approach was selected to summarise and compare findings regarding the detection of microcalcifications, while a hierarchical model with bivariate analysis was used for the meta-analysis of sensitivity and specificity for diagnosing microcalcifications. Results Nine studies were included. Phantom studies suggested that the size of microcalcifications, magnification or zoom factor, exposure factors and detector technology determine whether digital zoom is equivalent to magnification mammography in the detection of microcalcifications. Pooled sensitivity for magnification and zoom calculated from the diagnostic test studies was 0.93 (95% CI 0.84–0.97) and 0.85 (95% CI 0.70–0.94), respectively. Pooled specificity was 0.55 (95% CI 0.51–0.58) and 0.56 (95% CI 0.50–0.62), respectively. The differences between the sensitivities and specificities were not statistically significant. Conclusions Digital zoom may be equivalent to magnification mammography. Diagnostic test studies and phantom studies using newer detector technology would contribute additional knowledge on this topic. Key Points • The performance of digital zoom is comparable to magnification for detecting microcalcifications when newer detector technology and optimised imaging procedures are utilised. • The accuracy of digital zoom appears equivalent to geometric magnification in diagnosing microcalcifications.",0
https://doi.org/10.1007/s12094-020-02358-y,The impact of surgical margin status on prostate cancer-specific mortality after radical prostatectomy: a systematic review and meta-analysis,"Until now, there is no clear conclusion on the relationship between the surgical margin status after radical prostatectomy (RP) and prostate cancer-specific mortality (PCSM). Therefore, we conducted this systematic review and meta-analysis based on all eligible case–control studies. A systematic and comprehensive literature search was performed based on PUBMED and EMBASE to identify all of the potentially relevant publications which were published before September 2019. Hazard ratio (HR) for PCSM was independently extracted by two reviewers from all eligible studies. Pooled HR estimates with their corresponding 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) were computed by Stata12.0. Total 15 eligible studies were included in this meta-analysis. The pooled results showed that patients with positive surgical margin (PSM) after RP may have higher PCSM than those who had a negative surgical margin (HR 1.44, P = 0.043). In the subgroup analysis, we found that no matter whether the pathological stage of the patients is T2 or T3, PSM is indicative of a high PCSM and that the PCSM of T3 is higher than T2 (Pathological stage T3, HR 1.77, P = 0.032; Pathological stage T2, HR 1.56, P = 0.003). In addition, by performing the subgroup analysis of Gleason score, we concluded that both Gleason score 8–10 and Gleason score ≤ 7 would increase the risk of PCSM, and the former was more significant than the latter (Gleason score 8–10, HR 1.88, P < 0.001; Gleason score ≤ 7, HR 1.38, P = 0.039). Moreover, PSM increased PCSM regardless of whether the patients received radiation therapy or not (radiation therapy, HR 1.92, P < 0.001; no radiation therapy, HR 1.42, P < 0.001). This meta-analysis demonstrated that patients with PSM after RP may have an elevated PCSM. However, to evaluate these correlations in more details, it is necessary to conduct further studies on a larger sample size.",0

This article identifies the predictors and outcomes of burnout among PCPs in the United States. A comprehensive literature search of eight databases was conducted to identify studies investigating predictors or outcomes of PCP burnout. The Joanna Briggs Institute’s critical appraisal checklists for cross-sectional and cohort studies were used for quality appraisal. Overall, 21 studies met inclusion criteria, had sufficient quality, reported personal and/or organizational predictors of burnout, and described burnout outcomes at the patient, provider, or organizational level. Prevalence of PCP burnout ranged from 13.5% to 60%. The primary care practice environment was the most common predictor of PCP burnout. In conclusion, developing interventions to improve the practice environment may help reduce PCP burnout. Future studies using robust study designs and standardized instruments to consistently measure burnout are needed.",0

The present study was undertaken to systematically review the effect of resin infiltration (RI) technique on surface hardness (SH) of WSL.Five electronic databases were searched with proper key words. Related titles and abstracts, up to October 2018, were screened, selected, and subjected to quality assessments. After collecting data, meta-analyses were carried out to compare the effect of RI with untreated WSL and sound enamel by using the STATA software.A total of 4567 articles were included in the study after initial search. Finally, 10 studies were reliable enough in methodology to be included in the study. Metadata analyses, carried out on 7 studies that compared SH of RI group with untreated samples, showed a significant increase in SH with 3.66 mean difference (95% confidence interval = 2.56‒4.77, Q value = 36.07, I2 = 83.4%). However, meta-analysis on 4 studies that compared SH of RI with sound enamel showed a significant decrease in SH with -2.35 overall mean difference (95% confidence interval = -3.91-0.98, P = .00, Q value = 31.75, I2 = 90.6%).The RI technique can enhance SH of WSL; however, regaining the SH of RI-treated WSLs similar to sound enamel is doubtful. Application of RI is more effective than other methods, including application of fluoride, enamel pro-varnish, adhesive, and colloidal silica infiltration for enhancing SH of WSLs.",0

Hence, this systematic review is aimed to evaluate the prognostic role of E-cadherin in patients with prostatic carcinoma (PCa).A comprehensive literature search in all available databases will be conducted to identify eligible studies. We will employ hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) to estimate the correlations between E-cadherin expression and overall survival (OS), disease-free survival (DFS), relapse-free survival (RFS), progression-free survival (PFS) and clinicopathological features. Meta-analysis will be performed using Review Manager (Revman) 5.3.5 software (Cochrane Community, London, United Kingdom) and STATA 14 software (version 14.0; Stata Corp, College Station, TX).This study will provide a high-quality synthesis of current evidence of the correlations between snail expression and OS, DFS/RFS, PFS and clinicopathological features.The study will provide updated evidence to assess whether the expression of E-cadherin is in association with poor prognosis in patients with PCa.It is not necessary for ethical approval because individuals cannot be identified. The protocol will be disseminated in a peer-reviewed journal or presented at a relevant conference.This systematic review protocol has been registered in the PROSPERO network (No. CRD42019128353).",0

Searches for primary studies were conducted in Pubmed, Medline, Embase, PsycINFO and Web of Science. Of the 406 studies identified, 26 fulfilled the inclusion criteria for the qualitative synthesis whereas sixteen studies were included in the meta-analysis (cross sectional effect sizes: 15; N = 69,199/prospective effect sizes: 6; N = 26,164). Workplace bullying was significantly related to sleep problems in all studies. Across cross-sectional studies, targets of bullying had 2.31 higher odds of reporting sleep problems compared to non-bullied workers. The odds across the prospective studies was 1.62. The quality of evidence for the association between workplace bullying and sleep problems was low to moderate. Only eight studies had a predefined theoretical rationale for the association, and few studies examined mediating and moderating variables or bidirectional associations. The methodological quality of the studies was moderate. Further research is needed to establish the nature, directionality, mechanisms, and conditions of the association between bullying and sleep.",0
https://doi.org/10.1016/j.injury.2020.04.010,Bone regenerative medicine: metatarsus defects in sheep to evaluate new therapeutic strategies for human long bone defect. A systematic review,"Abstract Introduction: Large bone defects in long bone are not able to repair themselves and require grafts. Although autograft is the gold standard, it is associated with some disadvantages. Consequently, the application of tissue engineering (TE) techniques help with the use of allogenic biological and artificial scaffolds, cells and growth factors (GFs). Following 3Rs and in vitro testing strategies, animal models are required in preclinical in vivo studies to evaluate the therapeutic effects of the most promising TE techniques. Materials and methods: A systematic review was performed from 2000 to 2019 to evaluate bone regeneration sheep metatarsus defects. Results: Eleven in vivo studies on sheep metatarsus defect were retrieved. The mid-diaphysis of metatarsus was the region most employed to perform critical size defects. Natural, synthetic and hybrid scaffolds were implanted, combined with bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs), GFs such as osteogenic protein 1 (OP1) and platelet rich plasma (PRP). The maximum follow-up period was 4 and 6 months in which radiography, histology, histomorphometry, computed tomography (CT) and biomechanics were performed to evaluate the healing status. Conclusions: the sheep metatarsus defect model seems to be a suitable environment with a good marriage of biological and biomechanical properties. Defects of 3 cm are treated with natural scaffolds (homologous graft or allografts), those of 2.5 cm with natural, synthetic or composite scaffolds, while little defects (0.5 × 0.5 cm) with composite scaffolds. No difference in results is found regardless of the defect size.",0

However, HIV is not routinely recognized as a sarcopenia risk factor outside of HIV literature. The purposes of this study were to establish the prevalence and predictors of sarcopenia among PLHIV, and to compare the prevalence of sarcopenia among PLHIV and people without HIV. A systematic literature search of the PubMed, Embase, Cinahl, and Scielo databases was performed following PRISMA and MOOSE guidelines. Identified articles were included if they evaluated sarcopenia among PLHIV using either the presence of low muscle mass only or low muscle mass in association with low muscle function. The pooled prevalence of sarcopenia among PLHIV and the odds ratio for sarcopenia in PLHIV compared with controls were calculated. From 13 studies and 2267 participants, the prevalence of sarcopenia among PLHIV was 24.1% (95% CI = 17.8–31.0%). PLHIV presented 6.1 greater odds (95% CI = 1.1–33.5) of sarcopenia compared with people without HIV, matched by age, sex, BMI, and ethnicity. Longer exposure to specific HIV drugs, tobacco and alcohol, lower education and employment rates, and greater HIV duration were associated with sarcopenia. In conclusion, PLHIV had a high prevalence of sarcopenia, related to both HIV and non-HIV risk factors. HIV should be considered a risk factor for sarcopenia in the general population.

https://doi.org/10.1177/1524838020915584,Violence Exposure and Mental Health Among Resettled Refugees: A Systematic Review,"Refugee populations are often characterized by their high exposure to violence, which are tied to various challenges upon resettlement. This systematic review synthesizes the empirical literature related to violence exposure for refugees resettled in high-income countries and the impact of that exposure on mental health symptoms. The authors reviewed quantitative studies published from 2000 to 2018 and found 12 studies met criteria for inclusion. Studies were excluded if the study did not include a measured mental health outcome, if violence exposure was not measured and reported on distinctly from nonviolent exposures, if the sample did not include a refugee population, or if the relationship between violence exposure and mental health of refugees was not empirically examined. Overall, studies found that resettled refugee populations were more likely to have higher rates of violence exposure than comparison groups. This violence exposure was significantly related to higher mental health symptoms, including symptoms of depression, anxiety, and, most commonly reported, posttraumatic stress disorder. However, there is substantial heterogeneity in measurement of violence exposure, particularly in the use of author-created scales. The vast majority of included studies examined only exposure to violence prior to resettlement. The review shows significant evidence for the effect of violence prior to resettlement on mental health after resettlement and reveals a need for improved measurement and definitions of violence exposure at different time points for resettled refugee populations. Assessing current exposure to violence is an important step for effective intervention related to mental health dilemmas for refugee populations.",0

Comprehensive meta-data on the impact of statins on major adverse limb events (MALE) in PAD patients are lacking. We examined the association of statin use with MALE in patients with PAD. Methods We performed a systematic review (registered at PROSPERO: number CRD42019137111) and metanalysis of studies retrieved from PubMed (via MEDLINE) and Cochrane (CENTRAL) databases addressing the impact of statin on MALE including amputation and graft occlusion/revascularization. Secondary endpoints were all-cause death, composite CV endpoints, CV death, and stroke. Results We included 51 studies with 138,060 PAD patients, of whom 48,459 (35.1%) were treated with statins. The analysis included 2 randomized controlled trials, 20 prospective, and 29 retrospective studies. Overall, 11,396 MALE events, 21,624 deaths, 4,852 composite CV endpoints, 4,609 CV deaths, and 860 strokes were used for the analysis. Statins reduced MALE incidence by 30% (pooled hazard ratio [HR]: 0.702; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.605–0.815) and amputations by 35% (HR: 0.654; 95% CI: 0.522–0.819), all-cause mortality by 39% (pooled HR: 0.608, 95% CI: 0.543–0.680), CV death by 41% (HR: 0.594; 95% CI: 0.455–0.777), composite CV endpoints by 34% (pooled HR: 0.662; 95% CI: 0.591–0.741) and ischemic stroke by 28% (pooled HR: 0.718; 95% CI: 0.620–0.831). Conclusion Statins reduce the incidence of MALE, all-cause, and CV mortality in patients with PAD. In PAD, a high proportion of MALE events and deaths could be prevented by implementing a statin prescription in this patient population.",0

Various countries have developed toolkits to determine High Conservation Value Areas (HCVAs) according to their needs and conservation strategies but there is no global agreement on them. The present study attempts to review research papers and assessment reports from 1999 until 2018 on approaches and methodologies used for HCVs all over the world and provide a review into HCV research systematically, with due consideration to the linkages between Biodiversity, Ecosystem Services and Socio-Economic-Cultural values. We analyzed and examined the trends which are emerging and gaps present in HCV assessments evident from literature reviewed by experts, including the spatial spread of research, the evolving use and content of the concept, and consultation with stakeholders. A total, 80 articles were taken from Scopus and various reputed journals and reports using keywords like HCV and Forest Stewardship Council (FSC) to specifically focus on the application and evolution of the concept designed by FSC. The study was done in the hope to help in analyzing different HCV components as a conservation planning tool and guide new research in methodologies to fill the current gaps and enhance HCV assessments at different levels of application. The review result revealed that the HCV approach is an effective tool for delineating the conservation priority areas and reduce the uncontrolled extraction of natural resources. The findings display the focus area in HCV research that are surveying methods, fields of application and the dynamics between social and environmental components of HCV categories.",0

By conducting a systematic review and meta-analysis, this study aimed to compare clinical outcomes in patients with resectable PC who underwent surgery with or without IORT. Methods and materials The MEDLINE/PubMed, EMBASE, and Cochrane Library databases were searched to identify relevant studies published up to February 28, 2019. The main outcome measures included median survival time (MST), local recurrence (LR), postoperative complications, and operation-related mortality. Pooled effect estimates were obtained by performing a random-effects meta-analysis. Results A total of 1095 studies were screened for inclusion, of which 15 studies with 834 patients were included in the meta-analysis. Overall, 401 patients underwent pancreatic resection with IORT and 433 underwent surgery without IORT. The pooled analysis revealed that IORT group experienced favorable overall survival (median survival rate [MSR], 1.20; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.06–1.37, P = 0.005), compared with patients who did not receive IORT. Additionally, the pooled data showed a significantly reduced LR rate in the IORT group compared with that in the non-IORT group (relative risk [RR], 0.70; 95% CI, 0.51–0.97, P = 0.03). The incidences of postoperative complications (RR, 0.95; 95% CI, 0.73–1.23) and operation-related mortality (RR, 1.07; 95% CI, 0.44–2.63) were similar between the IORT and non-IORT groups. Conclusion IORT significantly improved locoregional control and overall survival in patients with resectable PC, without increasing postoperative complications and operation-related mortality rates.",0
https://doi.org/10.1186/s13643-020-01345-2,Treatment of pre- and confirmed cervical cancer in HIV-seropositive women from developing countries: a systematic review,"Abstract Background Cervical cancer has become a major public health challenge in developing countries with a reported age-standardised incidence rate of about 17.9/100,000/year and lifetime risks approaching 1 in 20 in some settings. Evidence indicates that HIV-seropositive women are 2 to 12 times more likely to develop precancerous lesions that lead to cervical cancer than HIV-negative women. There is a lack of rigorous evidence on which treatment methods are being utilised for HIV-positive women, and this review aims to synthesise available evidence on treatment modalities for both cervical neoplasia and cervical cancer in HIV-seropositive women in developing countries. Methods A systematic review guided by a published protocol was conducted. Online databases including MEDLINE/PubMed, Embase, CINAHL and Emerald (via EBSCOhost), PsycINFO, Cochrane Library, and health databases, which cover developing countries (3ie Systematic Reviews, WHO library and databases, World Bank website), were searched for published articles. Additional articles were found through citation, reference list tracking, and grey literature. Study design, treatment category, geographic country/region, and key outcomes for each included article were documented and summarised. Results Thirteen research articles from sub-Saharan Africa, Asia, and South America were included. Eight (61.5%) articles focused on the treatment of cervical cancer with the remaining five (38.5%) assessed cervical neoplasia treatment. The available cervical cancer treatments, radiotherapy, chemotherapy, chemoradiation, and surgery are effective for HIV-seropositive patients, and these are the same treatments for HIV-negative patients. Both cryotherapy and LEEP are effective in reducing CIN2+ among HIV-seropositive women, and a choice between the treatments might be based on available resources and expertise. Radiation, chemotherapy, concurrent treatment using radiotherapy and chemotherapy, and surgery have shown the possibility of effectiveness among HIV-seropositive women. Cervical cancer stage, immunosuppressive level including those on HAART, and multisystem toxicities due to treatment are associated with treatment completion, prognostic, and survival outcomes. Conclusions Treatment of cervical cancer is based on the stage of cancer, and poor outcomes in most developing countries might be due to a lack of optimal treatment regimen. Those infected with HIV were younger and had advanced cervical cancer as compared to those who were HIV-negative. Facilitation and putting HIV-infected people on life-long ART is of importance and has been found to have a positive impact on cervical cancer treatment response. Research on precancerous lesions and cervical cancer management of HIV-seropositive patients focusing on the quality of life of those treated; the effectiveness of the treatment method considering CD4+ count and ART is required.

Using PRISMA guidelines, appropriate databases were searched. 190 papers were returned with 38 articles fully reviewed. Articles were each independently quality rated by two authors using the Crowe Critical Appraisal Tool and data were extracted. Of the 38 articles, 23 were rated as very high quality. Most study participants were adults ( n = 7769) with n = 727 child participants. Only seven of the very/high-quality studies were prospective and involved children. Methylation was the most studied method of epigenetic modification. There is some evidence supporting epigenetic modification of certain markers in participants exposed to ACEs measured in adulthood. Research is lacking on non-coding aspects of the epigenome and on coding aspects other than DNA methylation. There is some evidence of a more powerful effect on telomere length if physical neglect was involved. Much further work is required to model biological and psychological effects of epigenetic changes during childhood using prospective study designs. The effect of ACEs on the cellular ageing process during childhood is inadequately investigated and relies solely on measure of telomere length. Future research suggestions are proposed.",0
https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jnma.2020.02.008,Discrimination Toward Physicians of Color: A Systematic Review,"To systematically review published research exploring workplace discrimination toward physicians of color with a focus on discrimination from patients. The authors searched PubMed, PsycInfo, CINAHL, Scopus, Academic Search Premier, and Web of Science from 1990 through 2017 and performed supplemental manual bibliographic searches. Eligible studies were in English and assessed workplace discrimination experienced by physicians of color practicing in the U.S. including physicians from ethnic/racial groups underrepresented in medicine, Asians, and international medical graduates. Two reviewers independently screened titles and abstracts, 3 reviewers read the full text of eligible studies, and 2 reviewers extracted data and appraised quality using Joanna Briggs Institute checklist for qualitative research or the AXIS tool for quality of cross-sectional studies. Of the 19 eligible studies, 6 conducted surveys and 13 analyzed data from interviews and/or focus groups; most were medium quality. All provided evidence to support the high prevalence of workplace discrimination experienced by physicians of color, particularly black physicians and women of color. Discrimination was associated with adverse effects on career, work environment, and health. In the few studies inquiring about patient interactions, discrimination was predominantly refusal of care. No study evaluated an intervention to reduce workplace discrimination experienced by physicians of color. Ethnic/racial groups were inconsistent across studies, and some samples included physicians in Canada, non-physician faculty, or trainees. With physicians of color comprising a growing percentage of the U.S. physician workforce, healthcare organizations must examine and implement effective ways to ensure a healthy and supportive work environment.",0

However, this knowledge is limited. The present study aims to summarize previous studies by performing a systematic review and meta-analyses. The terms “multiple sclerosis” combined with DMDs of interest and a broad profile for pregnancy terms were used to search Embase and Medline databases to identify relevant studies published from January 2000 to July 2019.1260 studies were identified and ten studies met our inclusion criteria. Pooled risk ratios (RR) of pregnancy and birth outcomes in pregnancies exposed to DMDs compared to those not exposed were calculated using a random effects model. For spontaneous abortion RR = 1.14, 95% CI 0.99–1.32, for preterm births RR = 0.93, 95% CI 0.72–1.21 and for major congenital malformations RR = 0.86, 95% CI 0.47–1.56. The most common major congenital malformations reported in MS patients exposed to MS drugs were atrial septal defect (ASD) ( N = 4), polydactyly ( N = 4) and club foot ( N = 3), which are among the most prevalent birth defects observed in the general population. In conclusion, interferons, glatiramer acetate or natalizumab, do not appear to increase the risk for spontaneous abortions, pre-term birth or major congenital malformations. There were very few patients included that were exposed to fingolimod, azathioprine and rituximab; therefore, these results cannot be generalized across drugs. Future studies including internal comparators are needed to enable treating physicians and their patients to decide on the best treatment options.",0
https://doi.org/10.1002/joa3.12294,Longer diagnosis‐to‐ablation time is associated with recurrence of atrial fibrillation after catheter ablation—Systematic review and meta‐analysis,"Diagnosis-to-ablation time (DTAT) has been postulated to be one of the predictors of atrial fibrillation (AF) recurrence, and it is a ""modifiable"" risk factor unlike that of many electrocardiographic or echocardiographic parameters. This development may change our consideration for ablation. In this systematic review and meta-analysis, we aim to analyze the latest evidence on the importance of DTAT and whether they predict the AF recurrence after catheter ablation.We performed a comprehensive search on topics that assess diagnosis-to-ablation time (DTAT) and AF recurrence from inception up until August 2019 through PubMed, EuropePMC, Cochrane Central Database, and http://ClinicalTrials.gov.There was a total of 3548 patients from six studies. Longer DTAT was associated with increased risk for AF recurrence in all studies included. Meta-analysis of these studies showed that DTAT had a hazard ratio (HR) of 1.19 [1.02, 1.39], P = .03; I2: 92% for AF recurrence. Upon sensitivity analysis by removing a study, HR became 1.24 [1.16, 1.32], P < .001; I2: 29%. Meta-analysis on DTAT time >3 years had HR 1.73 [1.54, 1.93], P < .001; I2: 45% for the recurrence of AF. Upon subgroup analysis of data that compared >6 years to <1 year, the HR was 1.93 [1.62, 2.29], P < .001; I2: 0%.Longer DTAT time is associated with an increased risk of AF recurrence. Hence, determining management at the earliest possible moment to avoid delay is of utmost importance.",0

A systematic review and meta-analysis","Aim This study summarised available evidence on the association between early and on-time retirement, compared with continued working, and mortality. Moreover, this study investigated whether and to what extent gender, adjustment for demographics and prior health status influence this association. Methods A systematic literature search of longitudinal studies was conducted. A qualitative analysis of the included studies was performed, followed by a meta-regression analysis to assess the influence of gender, prior health and demographics. Random-effects models were used in a meta-analysis to estimate the pooled effects for relevant subgroups identified in the meta-regression. Results In total, 25 studies were included. Adjustment for prior health and demographics influenced the association between retirement and mortality (p&lt;0.05). The results of the meta-analysis of 12 studies are presented for ‘insufficiently adjusted’ and ‘fully adjusted’ subgroups. There was no association between early retirement and mortality compared with working until retirement (fully adjusted subgroup: HR 1.05, 95% CI 0.87 to 1.28). On-time retirement was associated with a higher risk of mortality compared with working beyond retirement (insufficiently adjusted subgroup: HR 1.56, 95% CI 1.41 to 1.73). However, in the subgroup that adjusted for prior health, on-time retirement was not associated with mortality (HR 1.12, 95% CI 0.98 to 1.28). Conclusion Early retirement was not associated with a higher risk of mortality. On-time retirement was associated with a higher risk of mortality, which might reflect the healthy worker effect. It is important to consider information on prior health and demographics when studying the association between retirement and mortality to avoid biased findings.",0

We sought to determine the efficacy of tobacco and/or cannabis use interventions delivered to co-users on cannabis and tobacco use outcomes. Method Systematic review with meta-analysis and narrative review, using five databases and author requests for co-use data. Controlled and uncontrolled intervention studies focusing on treatment of tobacco and/or cannabis use assessing use of both pre- and post-intervention were included. Prevention interventions were excluded. Bayesian meta-analysis was used across four outcome measures: risk ratio for tobacco and cannabis cessation post-intervention separately; standardized mean change for tobacco and cannabis reduction post-intervention separately. Narrative reporting of the same outcome measures in non-randomized clinical trials (non-RCTs) and quality assessment of all included studies were conducted. Results Twenty studies (12 RCTs and eight uncontrolled) were included. Bayesian meta-analysis with informative priors based on existing data of 11 RCTs (six single-substance, five multi-substance interventions) delivered to co-users (n = up to 1117) showed weak evidence for an effect on cannabis cessation [risk ratio (RR) = 1.48, credibility interval (CrI) = 0.92, 2.49, eight studies] and no clear effect on tobacco cessation (RR = 1.10, CrI = 0.68, 1.87, nine studies). Subgroup analysis suggested that multi-substance interventions might be more effective than cannabis-targeted interventions on cannabis cessation (RR = 2.19, CrI = 1.10, 4.36 versus RR = 1.39, CrI = 0.75, 2.74). A significant intervention effect was observed on cannabis reduction (RR = 0.25, CrI = 0.03, 0.45, nine studies) but not on tobacco reduction (RR = 0.06, CrI = -0.11, 0.23, nine studies). Quality of evidence was moderate, although measurement of co-use and cannabis use requires standardization. Uncontrolled studies targeting both cannabis and tobacco use indicated feasibility and acceptability. Conclusions Single and multi-substance interventions addressing tobacco and/or cannabis have not shown a clear effect on either tobacco or cannabis cessation and reduction among co-users. However, dual substance interventions targeting tobacco and cannabis appear feasible.",0

(1998). Given that deficits in executive functions (EF) are prominent in most forms of psychopathology across the lifespan, there is utility in considering how ACEs relate to EF outcomes. Objective To consolidate the research to date on the relationship between ACEs and EF outcomes among child samples. Methods A systematic review was conducted that included 16 scientific databases and 17 grey literatures. Results Across 36 studies, many examined EF related to forms of maltreatment (e.g. abuse, neglect, and exposure to intimate partner violence) and found a strong relationship between maltreatment and EF deficits among children. Similarly, family member mental illness (maternal depression in particular) was associated with poor EF outcomes. The relationship between other ACEs and EF outcomes have not been uniquely examined, including intimate partner violence and family member incarceration. Conclusions This review acts as a preliminary step towards broader understanding of outcomes related to early childhood experiences through the consideration of EFs. Through documentation of such relationships, it is possible to consider how prevention and treatment approaches may be improved.",0
https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jand.2020.01.001,Environmental Sustainability of Hospital Foodservices across the Food Supply Chain: A Systematic Review,"Hospitals have a responsibility to support human health, and given the link between human and environmental health, hospitals should consider their environmental impacts. Hospital foodservices can negatively affect the environment at every stage of the food supply chain (production/procurement, distribution, preparation, consumption, and waste management/disposal).To systematically identify and synthesize the following across the hospital patient food/nutrition supply chain: environmental and associated economic impacts of foodservice; outcomes of strategies that aim to improve the environmental sustainability of foodservice; and perspectives of patients, staff, and stakeholders on environmental impacts of foodservice and strategies that aim to improve the environmental sustainability of foodservice.Eight electronic databases (ie, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature Plus, Embase via Ovid, Global Health, National Health Service Economic Evaluation Database, Ovid Medline, ProQuest Environmental Science Collection, Scopus, and Web of Science) were searched from database inception to November 2018 for original research conducted across any stage of the hospital food supply chain (from production/procurement to waste management/disposal) that provides food/nutrition to patients, with no restrictions on language or study design. Titles/abstracts then full texts were screened independently by two authors. The Mixed Methods Appraisal Tool was used for quality appraisal for included studies. Data were synthesized narratively.From 29,655 records identified, 80 studies met eligibility criteria. Results were categorized into production/procurement (n=12), distribution (n=0), preparation (n=6), consumption (n=49), waste management/disposal (n=8), and multiple food supply chain aspects (n=5). The environmental impact most widely explored was food waste, with many studies reporting on food waste quantities, and associated economic losses. Strategies focused on reducing food waste by increasing patients' intake through various foodservice models. Perspectives identified a shared vision for sustainable foodservices, although there are many practical barriers to achieving this.The literature provides examples across the hospital food supply chain that demonstrate how environmental sustainability can be prioritized and evaluated and the opportunities for credentialed nutrition and dietetics practitioners to contribute. Future studies are warranted, particularly those measuring environmental impacts and testing the effects of sustainable strategies in the distribution, preparation, and waste management stages.",0

https://doi.org/10.1007/s13187-019-01548-9,"Managing Pain in People with Cancer—a Systematic Review of the Attitudes and Knowledge of Professionals, Patients, Caregivers and Public","Cancer pain is a common symptom experienced by patients, caused either by the disease or its treatment. Morphine remains the most effective and recommended treatment for cancer pain. However, cancer patients still do not receive appropriate management for their pain, and under-treatment is common. Lack of knowledge and negative attitudes towards cancer pain and analgesia among professionals, patients and family caregivers are reported as one of the most common barriers to effective cancer pain management (CPM). To systematically review research on the nature and impact of attitudes and knowledge towards CPM, a systematic literature search of 6 databases (the Cochrane library, MEDLINE, PsycINFO, CINAHL, Web of Science and EMBASE) was undertaken in July 2018. Additionally, hand-searching of Google, Google Scholar and reference lists was conducted. The inclusion criteria were adult (18–65 years of age), studies which included attitudes and knowledge towards CPM, studies written in English, published literature only and cross-sectional design. Included studies were critically appraised by two researchers independently using the Joanna Briggs Institute Analytical Cross Sectional Studies Assessment (JBI-ACSSA). A total of 36 studies met the inclusion criteria. The main finding was that among professionals, patients, caregivers and the public there were similar attitudinal barriers to effective CPM. The most commonly cited barriers were fear of drug addiction, tolerance of medication and side effects of opioids. We also found differences between professional groups (physicians versus nurses) and between different countries based on their potential exposure to palliative care training and services. There are still barriers to effective CPM, which might result in unrelieved cancer pain. Therefore, more educational programmes and training for professionals on CPM are needed. Furthermore, patients, caregivers, and the public need more general awareness and adequate level of knowledge about CPM.",0
https://doi.org/10.1016/j.clineuro.2020.105821,Factors Associated with Higher Rates of Heterotopic Ossification after Spinal Cord Injury: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis,"Heterotopic Ossification (HO) refers to the formation of bone within soft tissue. Traumatic spinal cord injury (SCI) has been shown to be associated with development of HO. However, risk factors for HO following SCI are unknown. In light of this knowledge gap, we performed a systematic review and meta-analysis to summarize available evidence and elucidate risk factors associated with heterotopic ossification. An electronic literature search was conducted using five databases. Studies containing SCI patients, with a proportion diagnosed with HO, were included. Meta-analyses were performed to assess the association between following risk factors and development of HO: sex, type of injury, spasticity, pressure ulcer, injury level, urinary tract infection (UTI), deep vein thrombosis (DVT), number of smokers, and pneumonia. Nine studies with 2,115 patients were included. It was found that males (Odds Ratio [95% Confidence Interval]: 2.25 [1.61, 3.13]), smokers (2.88 [1.62, 5.11]), patients with complete injury (3.61 [2.29, 5.71]), pneumonia (2.86 [2.18, 3.75]), pressure ulcers (2.45 [1.89, 3.18]), UTI (3.84 [2.63, 5.62]) and spasticity (2.12 [1.67, 2.68]) had significantly higher odds of developing HO after spinal cord injury. In contrast, location of injury (Cervical vs. thoracic injury; (1.03 [0.72, 1.49]) and DVT (1.37 [0.91, 2.07]) were not associated with development of HO. Pooled results from existing literature on HO development show that several factors are significantly associated with development of HO. Given the complexity of SCI management, the results might have a positive impact on the clinical practice by leading to an effective screening aproach.",0
https://doi.org/10.1111/head.13802,Serotonin and Neuropeptides in Blood From Episodic and Chronic Migraine and Cluster Headache Patients in Case‐Control and Case‐Crossover Settings: A Systematic Review and Meta‐Analysis,"Objective: The aim of this systematic review and meta-analysis (SR-MA) was to identify signaling molecule profiles and blood-derived biomarkers in migraine and cluster headache (CH) patients. Background: Currently no migraine and CH valid biomarkers are available. Blood tests based on biomarker profiles have been used to gather information about the nervous system. Such tests have not yet been established within the primary headache field. Methods: Case-control and case-crossover studies investigating whole blood, plasma, and serum were identified worldwide. The qualitative synthesis focused on 9 signaling molecules (serotonin [5-HT], calcitonin gene-related peptide [CGRP], endothelin-1 [ET-1], neurokinin A, neurokinin B, neuropeptide Y, pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating peptide 38 [PACAP-38], substance P (SP), and vasoactive intestinal peptide) and the quantitative synthesis on 5-HT and CGRP (≥5 comparisons available). The meta-analysis was conducted using standard and 3-level random effect models. Results: Fifty-four eligible studies were identified (87.0% migraine, 9.3% CH, 3.7% migraine, and CH), and 2768 headache patients and 1165 controls included. Comparable fluctuations of 5-HT, CGRP, ET-1, PACAP-38, and SP in blood were generally observed between migraine and CH. Significant findings were observed for some subgroups and strata, for example, higher interictal and ictal 5-HT venous blood levels (ratio of means = 1.32, 95% CI: 1.08; 1.61; ratio of means = 1.23, 95% CI: 1.01; 1.49) in episodic migraine with aura with a female-dominated case group, higher interictal CGRP blood levels in episodic migraine (ratio of means = 1.63, 95% CI: 1.18; 2.26), and chronic migraine (ratio of means = 1.89, 95% CI: 1.33; 2.68), and higher ictal CGRP blood levels (ratio of means = 1.35, 95% CI: 1.09; 1.68) in episodic migraine were observed. In most subgroups, the quantitative synthesis revealed a high degree of heterogeneity between studies in part explained by the blood sampling site, specimen source, blood specimen, and sex distribution. Other potential confounders were age, aura, study quality, menstrual cycle, and methodology (eg, storage temperature). Conclusions: Potential migraine and CH signaling molecule profiles and biomarkers were revealed. Nevertheless, the high degree of heterogeneity between studies impedes identification of valid biomarkers but allowed us to assess the presence of confounders. Consideration of the potential confounders identified in this SR-MA might be of importance in the experimental planning of future studies. This consideration could be incorporated through establishment of specific guidelines. (Less)",0

Methods and Materials We performed a comprehensive literature search of the Embase and PubMed databases of studies reporting outcome or toxicity data for photon-based SBRT of adrenal metastases in accordance with Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines. We then conducted a meta-analysis to estimate pooled overall response, local control (LC), and overall survival and analyzed these outcomes in the context of dosimetric parameters and toxicity using metaregression. Results Thirty-nine studies published between 2009 and 2019 reporting outcomes on 1006 patients were included. The median follow-up was 12 months, and the median biological equivalent dose (BED10, alpha/beta = 10) was 67 Gy. The pooled overall response was 54.6% (95% confidence interval [CI], 46.5%-62.5%). The pooled 1- and 2-year rates of LC were 82% (95% CI, 74%-88%) and 63% (95% CI, 50%-74%), respectively, and the pooled 1- and 2-year overall survival rates were 66% (95% CI, 57%-74%) and 42% (95% CI, 31%-53%), respectively. There was a strong positive association between SBRT dose and 1- and 2-year LC (P Conclusions SBRT of adrenal metastases provides good 1-year LC with an excellent safety profile, and dose escalation may be associated with improved LC. Prospective studies are needed to validate these findings and determine whether there are subsets of patients for whom adrenal metastasis–directed SBRT may confer a survival advantage.",0

Objective A systematic review and meta-analysis was conducted to evaluate the association between ROP and SGA in preterm infants &lt;37 weeks’ gestational age (GA) admitted to neonatal intensive care unit. Methods Medline, PubMed, Web of Science and Cochrane Central databases were searched from inception through 15 January 2019. Studies reporting outcomes based on SGA as the primary exposure variable were included. Data were extracted independently by two coauthors. Modified Newcastle-Ottawa scale was used for risk of bias assessment. Results Database search yielded 536 records (Medline=152, PubMed=171, Web of Science=144 and Cochrane Central=69). Twenty-one studies evaluating 190 946 infants were included. SGA was associated with significantly higher odds of any stage of ROP on unadjusted analysis (unadjusted OR (uOR) 1.55; 95% CI 1.22 to 1.98; 10 studies) but not on adjusted analysis (adjusted OR (aOR) 2.16; 95% CI 0.66 to 7.11; 3 studies). SGA was associated with significantly higher odds of severe ROP (aOR 1.92; 95% CI 1.57 to 2.34; nine studies). SGA was also significantly associated with higher odds of treated ROP (aOR 1.39; 95% CI 1.18 to 1.65; three studies). In subgroup analysis of infants &lt;29 weeks’ GA, SGA was significantly associated with increased odds of ROP (uOR 1.64; 95% CI 1.19 to 2.26; two studies), severe ROP (aOR 1.61; 95% CI 1.23 to 2.10; four studies) and treated ROP (aOR 1.37; 95% CI 1.16 to 1.62; two studies). Conclusion SGA was associated with increased odds of any stage of ROP, severe ROP and treated ROP in preterm infants. Neonatologists should incorporate SGA into the risk assessment during ROP evaluation and while providing counselling to the families of preterm SGA infants. ROP screening guidelines should look into the frequency of follow-up examination in SGA infants in aim to offer early detection and treatment.",0

This systematic review investigated associations between sedentary behaviour and cognitive function in older adults without dementia, and possible mechanisms involved. Major databases were searched for studies in English between 01/01/1999 and 31/10/2019. The systematic review followed COSMOS-E guideline and a pre-registered protocol (CRD42019122229). Risk of bias was assessed using NICE Quality appraisal checklist. Findings were narratively synthesized and presented. Eighteen studies comprised of 13 cross-sectional and five longitudinal analyses (n = 40,228). Evidence suggested varied associations between varied sedentary behaviours and cognitive function in older adults. 50% of study analyses did not control for physical activity. 3/18 studies demonstrated associations between higher sedentary levels and lower levels of brain biomarkers, while 1/18 showed auto-regulatory effect in the left hippocampus. Conducting a meta-analysis was not justifiable due to considerable methodological, participant, outcome and exposure heterogeneity. There is a lack of clarity about the overall and independent association between sedentary behaviour and cognition in older age. Underlying mechanisms are similar to physical activity and probably multi-modal. More studies with robust designs and methodology are needed to confirm effect of sedentary behaviour on cognition.",0

Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is one of two first-line treatments of youth AD and it has previously been shown to be superior to wait-list but not placebo therapy. This study consists of a systematic review and meta-analysis of the literature to assess the efficacy of CBT modalities in comparison to control contingencies for pediatric anxiety disorders.Methods: Studies were included if they were randomized controlled trials, and if CBT was manualized or modular, alone or in combination with medication. CBT was required to include behavioral treatment, exposure treatment, or cognitive elements. Eligible studies included participants aged 18 years or younger.Results: Eighty-one studies were included, with 3386 CBT participants and 2527 control participants. The overall results indicated that CBT is an effective treatment for childhood AD. The results showed that individual-based CBT is superior to wait-list and attention control. Group-based CBT is superior to wait-list control and treatment as usual. Remote-based CBT was superior to attention control and wait-list control. Family-based CBT was superior to treatment as usual, wait-list control, and attention control. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors were no more effective than individual-based CBT. Combination treatment was, however, more effective than individual-based CBT.Conclusion: To the best of our knowledge, no meta-analysis has thus far disentangled the effects of CBT modalities across various comparisons. This meta-analysis hence provides an important update to the literature on the efficacy of CBT for treating anxiety disorders in young people.",0
https://doi.org/10.1002/bjs.11488,Efficacy of antireflux surgery in children with or without neurological impairment: a systematic review,"Abstract Background Antireflux surgery is commonly performed in children, yet evidence for its efficacy is limited. The aim of this review was to determine the effect of antireflux surgery with regard to objective measures of quality of life (QoL) and value of upper gastrointestinal investigations in neurologically normal (NN) and neurologically impaired (NI) children. Methods A systematic review was conducted of articles reporting children undergoing antireflux surgery in whom preoperative and postoperative objective testing was performed. Primarily, Embase, CINAHL, MEDLINE and PubMed were searched from inception to April 2019. Methodological Index for Non-randomized Studies (MINORS) criteria were used to assess article quality. Results Of 789 articles, 14 met the eligibility criteria, 12 prospective observational and 2 retrospective studies. The median MINORS score was 59·4 (i.q.r. 39 to 62·5) per cent. Seven studies reported assessment of validated QoL measures before and after antireflux surgery in 148 children. Follow-up ranged from 1 to 180 months. All studies confirmed significant improvements in QoL measures among NN and NI children at all follow-up points. Eleven studies reported on preoperative and postoperative investigations in between 416 and 440 children children. Follow-up ranged from 0·5 to 180 months. Nine studies confirmed improvements in gastro-oesophageal reflux using 24-h oesophageal pH monitoring with or without manometry, but conflicting results were identified for four studies reporting gastric emptying. No studies reported fluoroscopy or endoscopy adequately. Conclusion Based on the results of studies of low-to-moderate quality, antireflux surgery improved QoL and reduced oesophageal acid exposure in NN and NI children in the short and medium term. Although antireflux surgery is a common elective operation, the lack of rigorous preoperative and postoperative evaluation(s) in the majority of patient-reported studies is striking.",0

However, evidence supporting treatment guidelines for uncomplicated (including asymptomatic) falciparum malaria in pregnant women is scarce and assessed in varied ways. We did a systematic literature review and individual patient data (IPD) meta-analysis to compare the efficacy and tolerability of different artemisinin-based or quinine-based treatments for malaria in pregnant women.We did a systematic review of interventional or observational cohort studies assessing the efficacy of artemisinin-based or quinine-based treatments in pregnancy. Seven databases (MEDLINE, Embase, Global Health, Cochrane Library, Scopus, Web of Science, and Literatura Latino Americana em Ciencias da Saude) and two clinical trial registries (International Clinical Trials Registry Platform and ClinicalTrials.gov) were searched. The final search was done on April 26, 2019. Studies that assessed PCR-corrected treatment efficacy in pregnancy with follow-up of 28 days or more were included. Investigators of identified studies were invited to share data from individual patients. The outcomes assessed included PCR-corrected efficacy, PCR-uncorrected efficacy, parasite clearance, fever clearance, gametocyte development, and acute adverse events. One-stage IPD meta-analysis using Cox and logistic regression with random-effects was done to estimate the risk factors associated with PCR-corrected treatment failure, using artemether-lumefantrine as the reference. This study is registered with PROSPERO, CRD42018104013.Of the 30 studies assessed, 19 were included, representing 92% of patients in the literature (4968 of 5360 episodes). Risk of PCR-corrected treatment failure was higher for the quinine monotherapy (n=244, adjusted hazard ratio [aHR] 6·11, 95% CI 2·57-14·54, p<0·0001) but lower for artesunate-amodiaquine (n=840, 0·27, 95% 0·14-0·52, p<0·0001), artesunate-mefloquine (n=1028, 0·56, 95% 0·34-0·94, p=0·03), and dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine (n=872, 0·35, 95% CI 0·18-0·68, p=0·002) than artemether-lumefantrine (n=1278) after adjustment for baseline asexual parasitaemia and parity. The risk of gametocyte carriage on day 7 was higher after quinine-based therapy than artemisinin-based treatment (adjusted odds ratio [OR] 7·38, 95% CI 2·29-23·82).Efficacy and tolerability of artemisinin-based combination therapies (ACTs) in pregnant women are better than quinine.

Sleep hygiene is defined as a set of behavioural, environmental, or cognitive modifications to improve sleep, and is routinely clinically utilised as first-line treatment for insomnia in ADHD. The objective of this systematic review of the literature is to evaluate the effectiveness of sleep hygiene interventions for sleep difficulties in children with ADHD. Sixteen relevant articles met the inclusion criteria, involving 1,469 participants, with a mean age of 9.6 years, across 6 countries. Fifteen studies found that sleep hygiene interventions were effective in improving sleep, while one did not show any significant improvement. Definite conclusions on the effectiveness of the interventions are difficult to draw due to the limited number of studies and a high risk of bias.

Many of these studies focus on individual classes of chemicals, with a few considering a broad range of systemic exposures. As yet, no review process has been undertaken to comprehensively examine these studies. The aims of this review are to: (1) ascertain whether biomonitoring studies pertaining to firefighters demonstrate occupational exposure to volatile organic compounds, semivolatile organic compounds, and metals; (2) determine and present results of biomonitoring studies; (3) provide any recommendations presented from the literature that may support exposure mitigation; and (4) suggest future study parameters that may assist in providing a greater understanding surrounding the occupational exposure of firefighters. A systematic review was undertaken with regards to firefighters and biomonitoring studies utilising the matrices of blood, urine, semen and breast milk. This yielded 5690 results. Following duplicate removal, inclusion and exclusion criteria screening and full text screening, 34 studies remained for review. Results of over 80% of studies analysed determined firefighters to experience occupational exposure. Results also show firefighters to be exposed to a wide range of toxic chemicals due to fire smoke; potentially exceeding the range of exposure of other occupations. As firefighters may face increased risk of health effects due to the additive, synergistic, and/or antagonistic effects of chemical exposure, all care must be taken to reduce exposure. This may be achieved by considering tactical decisions, increased personal hygiene, and thorough decontamination procedures. Future biomonitoring studies recognising and assessing the range of chemical exposure firefighters face would be beneficial.",0

A systematic review and meta-analysis was performed to assess the efficacy of CT scan to define muscle mass as a prognostic marker in gastric cancer (GC) patients undergoing gastrectomy and/or chemotherapy. The primary outcomes were overall survival (OS) and recurrence-free survival (RFS) and the secondary outcomes included postoperative length of hospital stay (P-LOS), total and severe complications in GC patients undergoing gastrectomy. <h3>Methods</h3> Three electronic bibliographic databases — MEDLINE, Web of Science and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials - were used to conduct a systematic literature search based on fixed inclusion and exclusion criteria, until April 2019. The adjusted and unadjusted hazard ratio (HR), odds ratio (OR) and mean difference (MD) with 95% confidence interval (CI) were used to analyse the dichotomous variables (OS, RFS, total and severe complications) and continuous variables (P-LOS). Random- and fixed effects models were used according to the heterogeneity. <h3>Results</h3> A total of 5610 GC patients from 20 studies were identified. Low muscle mass at diagnosis was found in 32.7% of GC patients and was significantly associated with poorer OS (HR 2.02, 95% CI 1.71–2.38, <i>p</i> < 0.00001, I<sup>2</sup> = 47%) and worse RFS (HR 1.97, 95% CI 1.71–2.26, <i>p</i> < 0.00001, I<sup>2</sup> = 0%). Meta-analysis of adjusted HR from multivariable analyses confirmed the association between OS and low muscle mass (HR 1.89, 95% CI 1.68–2.12, <i>p</i> < 0.00001, I<sup>2</sup> = 36%). Furthermore, low muscle mass and poorer OS were significantly associated in metastatic GC patients exclusively undergoing chemotherapy (HR 1.61, 95% CI 1.23–2.11, <i>p</i> < 0.0006, I<sup>2</sup> = 18%). Moreover, preoperative low muscle mass was significantly associated with longer P-LOS (MD 1.19, 95% CI 0.68–1.71, <i>p</i> < 0.00001, I<sup>2</sup> = 0%), higher risk of postoperative complications (OR 1.76, 95% CI 1.17–2.66, <i>p</i> = 0.007, I<sup>2</sup> = 77%) and severe complications (OR 1.54, 95% CI 1.03–2.29, <i>p</i> = 0.04, I<sup>2</sup> = 49%) in GC patients undergoing gastrectomy. <h3>Conclusions</h3> Low muscle mass, assessed by L3 CT-scan, affects almost 1/3 of GC patients at diagnosis and acts as a negative prognostic marker on many clinical outcomes. Therefore, identifying GC patients with low muscle mass at diagnosis or at follow-up visit should be recommendable. Clinical nutritionists should be part of tumor boards meetings to screen low muscle mass in order to prompt personalized nutritional support.",0
https://doi.org/10.1111/codi.14994,Postoperative chemotherapy improves survival in patients with resected high‐risk Stage II colorectal cancer: results of a systematic review and meta‐analysis,"Aim The aim was to assess the benefit of adjuvant chemotherapy in high-risk Stage II colorectal cancer. Method A systematic literature review and meta-analysis was performed comparing survival in patients with resected Stage II colorectal cancer and high-risk features having postoperative chemotherapy vs no chemotherapy. Results Of 1031 articles screened, 29 were included, reporting on 183 749 participants. Adjuvant chemotherapy significantly improved overall survival [hazard ratio (HR) 0.61, P < 0.0001], disease-specific survival (HR = 0.73, P = 0.05) and disease-free survival (HR = 0.59, P < 0.0001) compared to no chemotherapy. Adjuvant chemotherapy significantly increased 5-year overall survival (OR = 0.53, P = 0.0008) and 5-year disease-free survival (OR = 0.50, P = 0.001). Overall survival and disease-free survival remained significantly prolonged during subgroup analysis of studies published from 2015 onwards (HR = 0.60, P < 0.0001; HR = 0.65, P = 0.0001; respectively), in patients with two or more high-risk features (HR = 0.59, P = 0.0001; HR = 0.70, P = 0.03; respectively) and in colon cancer (HR = 0.61, P < 0.0001; HR = 0.51, P = 0.0001; respectively). Overall survival, disease-specific survival and disease-free survival during subgroup analysis of individual high-risk features were T4 tumour (HR = 0.58, P < 0.0001; HR = 0.50, P = 0.003; HR = 0.75, P = 0.05), < 12 lymph nodes harvested (HR = 0.67, P = 0.0002; HR = 0.80, P = 0.17; HR = 0.72, P = 0.02), poor differentiation (HR = 0.84, P = 0.35; HR = 0.85, P = 0.23; HR = 0.61, P = 0.41), lymphovascular or perineural invasion (HR = 0.55, P = 0.05; HR = 0.59, P = 0.11; HR = 0.76, P = 0.05) and emergency surgery (HR = 0.60, P = 0.02; HR = 0.68, P = 0.19). Conclusion Adjuvant chemotherapy in high-risk Stage II colorectal cancer results in a modest survival improvement and should be considered on an individual patient basis. Due to potential heterogeneity and selection bias of the included studies, and lack of separate rectal cancer data, further large randomized trials with predefined inclusion criteria and standardized chemotherapy regimens are required.",0

Continuing antibiotic prophylaxis after an operation might have no advantage compared with its immediate discontinuation, and it unnecessarily exposes patients to risks associated with antibiotic use. In 2016, WHO recommended discontinuation of antibiotic prophylaxis after surgery. We aimed to update the evidence that formed the basis for that recommendation.For this systematic review and meta-analysis, we searched MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, CENTRAL, and WHO regional medical databases for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) on postoperative antibiotic prophylaxis that were published from Jan 1, 1990, to July 24, 2018. RCTs comparing the effect of postoperative continuation versus discontinuation of antibiotic prophylaxis on the incidence of surgical site infection in patients undergoing any surgical procedure with an indication for antibiotic prophylaxis were eligible. The primary outcome was the effect of postoperative surgical antibiotic prophylaxis continuation versus its immediate discontinuation on the occurrence of surgical site infection, with a prespecified subgroup analysis for studies that did and did not adhere to current best practice standards for surgical antibiotic prophylaxis. We calculated summary relative risks (RRs) with corresponding 95% CIs using a random effects model (DerSimonian and Laird). We evaluated heterogeneity with the χ2 test, I2, and τ2, and visually assesed publication bias with a contour-enhanced funnel plot. This study is registered with PROSPERO, CRD42017060829.We identified 83 relevant RCTs, of which 52 RCTs with 19 273 participants were included in the primary meta-analysis. The pooled RR of surgical site infection with postoperative continuation of antibiotic prophylaxis versus its immediate discontinuation was 0·89 (95% CI 0·79-1·00), with low heterogeneity in effect size between studies (τ2=0·001, χ2 p=0·46, I2=0·7%). Our prespecified subgroup analysis showed a significant association between the effect estimate and adherence to best practice standards of surgical antibiotic prophylaxis: the RR of surgical site infection was reduced with continued antibiotic prophylaxis after surgery compared with its immediate discontinuation in trials that did not meet best practice standards (0·79 [95% CI 0·67-0·94]) but not in trials that did (1·04 [0·85-1·27]; p=0·048). Whether studies adhered to best practice standards explained all variance in the pooled estimate from the primary meta-analysis.Overall, we identified no conclusive evidence for a benefit of postoperative continuation of antibiotic prophylaxis over its discontinuation. When best practice standards were followed, postoperative continuation of antibiotic prophylaxis did not yield any additional benefit in reducing the incidence of surgical site infection. These findings support WHO recommendations against this practice.None.",0

However, the available evidence is controversial. Therefore, we performed a meta-analysis to determine the prognostic role of HA in breast cancer. METHODS The data were extracted from seven articles by searching the databases of PubMed, EMBASE, Web of Science, the Chinese National Knowledge Infrastructure and Wanfang data for the prognostic role of HA in breast cancer. In reference to survival outcomes, the pooled hazard ratios (HRs) of HA were calculated given a 95% confidence interval (CI). RESULTS A total of seven articles were included in our study involving 2664 cases. The result of meta-analysis showed that a high HA level predicts poor overall survival (OS) (HR = 1.86, 95% CI: 1.28-2.71, P = .001) and shortened disease-free or recurrence-free survival or progression free survival (DFS/RFS/PFS) (HR = 1.63, 95% CI: 1.14-2.33, P = .007) in breast cancer patients. Moreover, a high HA level in stroma (HR = 1.63, 95% CI: 1.06-2.51, P = .025) and plasma (HR = 3.26, 95% CI: 2.25-4.73, P < .001) significantly predicted poor OS. Besides, a tendency shows that HA was significantly correlated with lymph node metastasis (HR = 1.55, 95% CI: 0.96-2.49, P = .070) and tumor grade (HR = 2.10, 95% CI: 0.89-4.96, P = .089) on the clinical characteristics of patients. CONCLUSION These results suggested that HA has a potential to be prognostic biomarker in breast cancer patients, especially location in stroma and plasma.",0
https://doi.org/10.1111/coa.13527,A systematic review of the incidence of thyroid carcinoma in patients undergoing thyroidectomy for thyrotoxicosis,"Introduction Hyperthyroidism (HT) has been associated with no insignificant rates of thyroid malignancy. There are no current specific guidelines that suggest routine preoperative imaging for thyroid nodules in patients with Grave's disease. We therefore performed a systematic review assessing rates of thyroid malignancy in patients undergoing surgery for different causes of HT: Grave's disease (GD), toxic adenoma (TA) and toxic multinodular goitre (TMNG). Methods Major databases (MEDLINE, PubMed and the Cochrane library) were searched to identify eligible studies. Results After searching and appraising, 33 papers were found to be eligible for analysis. The mean overall rate of malignancy was 8.5% (range 0.8%-32.4%). The mean rates based on histological subtype were as follows: papillary thyroid cancer (PTC), 3.1% (range 0%-13.2%); micropapillary carcinoma (mPTC), 5.1% (range 0%-16.9%); and follicular thyroid cancer (FTC), 0.8% (range 0%-4.4%). In those patients who had preoperative imaging, mean malignancy rates were higher in patients with pre-identified nodules (19.8%) compared to those without any nodules (8.7%). Mean rates were lower in patients with GD/diffuse goitre (5.9%) compared to patients with TA (6.5%) and TMNG (12%). Conclusion Hyperthyroidism is associated with notable rates of thyroid cancer, although the mechanisms for this are not clear. The presence of nodules increases this risk. This review raises the question for considering preoperative assessment of nodules in all patients undergoing surgery for HT, in order to correctly assess and evaluate any patients with suspected concurrent thyroid malignancy, before proceeding with surgery.",0
https://doi.org/10.1177/1120700019887362,Intraoperative radiation exposure in hip arthroscopy: a systematic review,"Fluoroscopy is used in hip arthroscopy (HA) for portal placement, instrument localisation, and guidance in bony resection. The recent increase in arthroscopic hip procedures may place patients and surgeons at risk for increased radiation exposure and radiation-induced complications. The purpose of the current systematic review was to assess intraoperative radiation exposure in HA. The systematic review was conducted according to PRISMA guidelines; inclusion criteria were studies assessing radiation exposure in HA. 9 studies including 994 patients were included. Mean age was 38.6 years and 48% (436 of 906) were female. Mean time of fluoroscopy exposure was 0.58 minutes. Dose area product was 129.5 cGycm 2 . Mean intraoperative absorbed radiation dose studies was 12.6 mGy. Mean intraoperative effective dose was 0.48 mSv. The mean occupational exposure to the surgeon per case was 0.0031 mSv. Higher patient body mass index (BMI) correlated to greater patient effective and cumulative dose ( p &lt; 0.05, r = 0.404), and greater occupational exposure ( p &lt; 0.001, r = 0.460). Increasing surgeon experience decreased fluoroscopy time ( p = 0.039) and radiation dose ( p = 0.002). Radiation dose and effective dose were well under the thresholds for deterministic effects (2 Gy) and annual radiation exposure for occupational workers (20 mSv). Intraoperative radiation exposure to patients and surgeons is within acceptable annual radiation limits. Ensuring careful selection of perioperative imaging modalities, proper protective shielding, specifically the use of leaded eyeglasses, and optimal C-arm positioning are key strategies to reduce radiation exposure to patients and surgeons alike.",0

It is based on the ability of viruses to selectively kill cancer cells and induce host antitumor immune responses. However, the clinical outcomes of oncolytic viruses (OVs) vary widely. Therefore, we performed a meta-analysis to illustrate the efficacy and safety of oncolytic viruses. The Cochrane Library, PubMed, and EMBASE databases were searched for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) published up to 31 January 2020. The data for objective response rate (ORR), overall survival (OS), progression-free survival (PFS), and adverse events (AEs) were independently extracted by two investigators from 11 studies that met the inclusion criteria. In subgroup analyses, the objective response rate benefit was observed in patients treated with oncolytic DNA viruses (odds ratio (OR) = 4.05; 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.96–8.33; p = 0.0002), but not in those treated with oncolytic RNA viruses (OR = 1.00, 95% CI: 0.66–1.52, p = 0.99). Moreover, the intratumoral injection arm yielded a statistically significant improvement (OR = 4.05, 95% CI: 1.96–8.33, p = 0.0002), but no such improvement was observed for the intravenous injection arm (OR = 1.00, 95% CI: 0.66–1.52, p = 0.99). Among the five OVs investigated in RCTs, only talimogene laherparepvec (T-VEC) effectively prolonged the OS of patients (hazard ratio (HR), 0.79; 95% CI: 0.63–0.99; p = 0.04). None of the oncolytic virotherapies improved the PFS (HR = 1.00, 95% CI: 0.85–1.19, p = 0.96). Notably, the pooled rate of severe AEs (grade ≥3) was higher for the oncolytic virotherapy group (39%) compared with the control group (27%) (risk difference (RD), 12%; risk ratio (RR), 1.44; 95% CI: 1.17–1.78; p = 0.0006). This review offers a reference for fundamental research and clinical treatment of oncolytic viruses. Further randomized controlled trials are needed to verify these results.",0

This article summarized evidence of the association between 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] levels in maternal blood in pregnancy or newborn blood at birth and neurodevelopmental outcomes, including cognition, psychomotor performance, language development, behavioral difficulties, attention deficit and hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), and autistic traits. PubMed, Web of Science and SCOPUS databases were systematically searched for epidemiologic studies published through May 2018 using keywords. Random-effects meta-analyses were conducted. Of 260 identified articles, 25 were included in the present review. Comparing the highest vs. the lowest category of prenatal 25(OH)D levels, the pooled beta coefficients were 0.95 (95% CI −0.03, 1.93; p = 0.05) for cognition, and 0.88 (95% CI −0.18, 1.93; p = 0.10) for psychomotor development. The pooled relative risk for ADHD was 0.72 (95% CI, 0.59, 0.89; p = 0.002), and the pooled odds ratio for autism-related traits was 0.42 (95% CI, 0.25, 0.71; p = 0.001). There was little evidence for protective effects of high prenatal 25(OH)D for language development and behavior difficulties. This meta-analysis provides supporting evidence that increased prenatal exposure to 25(OH)D levels is associated with improved cognitive development and reduced risk of ADHD and autism-related traits later in life. Associations represent a potentially high public health burden given the current prevalence of vitamin D deficiency and insufficiency among childbearing aging and pregnant women.",1
https://doi.org/10.1111/add.14870,Prevalence of respiratory conditions among people who use illicit opioids: a systematic review,"Background and Aims  There are growing concerns over the respiratory health of people who use illicit opioids due to high rates of opioid inhalation and tobacco smoking in this group. This study aimed to summarize the evidence relating illicit opioid use with poor respiratory health.    Methods  A systematic review of the literature on the association between illicit opioid use and respiratory health was undertaken in accordance with PRISMA guidance (Prospero ID=CRD42017059953). Electronic searches of MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, CINAHL and the Cochrane Library databases were undertaken (English language, published January 1980 ‐ November 2018). All study designs excluding case studies were considered. Studies were undertaken in community and hospital settings in the US (n= 23), UK (n=7), Australia (n=7), Netherlands (n=2), Canada (n=2), Ireland (n=1), Spain (n=1) and Iran (n=1). Measurements of respiratory disease, including asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and related symptoms were extracted. Data on respiratory related deaths and hospital admissions were also extracted. Meta‐analysis of prevalence data was undertaken using a random effects meta‐analysis model with parameters estimated using Markov chain Monte Carlo simulation.    Results  Meta‐analyses estimated prevalence of asthma in people who inject illicit opioids as 8.5% (95% predictive interval (PrI): 0.2%, 74.0%) and as 20.2% (95% PrI: 4.2%, 59.2%) in people who inhale illicit opioids. Prevalence of COPD in people who inject illicit opioids was estimated as 2.7% (95% (PrI): 0.0%, 50.4%) and as 17.9% (95% PrI: 0.6%, 89.5%) in people who inhale illicit opioids. There was evidence of moderate to extreme heterogeneity across studies.    Conclusions  There is evidence of increased burden of respiratory diseases in people who use illicit opioids. Due to heterogeneity of study design and samples it is difficult to gain accurate estimates of the prevalence of respiratory disease in this population.",1

We performed the present meta-analysis to determine its precise role in these patients. Methods We employed a multiple search strategy in the PubMed, EMBASE and Cochrane Library databases to identify eligible studies. Disease-free survival (DFS)/progression-free survival (PFS)/time to progression (TTP) and overall survival (OS) were used as outcomes with hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Heterogeneity among the studies and publication bias were also evaluated. Results A total of 40 studies including 16,696 lung cancer patients were eligible for the analysis. Overall, the pooled analysis showed that compared with normal platelet counts, elevated pretreatment platelet counts were associated with poorer OS (HR = 1.54, 95% CI: 1.37–1.72, P &lt; 0.001) and poorer DFS/PFS/TTP (HR = 1.62, 95% CI: 1.33–1.98, P &lt; 0.001) in patients with lung cancer. In subgroup analyses, elevated pretreatment platelet counts were also associated with poorer OS and DFS/PFS/TTP in most subgroups. There was no evidence of publication bias. Conclusions This meta-analysis revealed that elevated pretreatment platelet counts were an independent predictor of OS and DFS/PFS/TTP in lung cancer patients. Large-scale prospective studies and a validation study are warranted.",0

We also performed a meta-analysis on a subgroup of studies on calcium and blood lead levels. Data Sources PubMed, Embase, and CINAHL databases were searched in July 2019. Study Selection We included articles published in English in any year that reported the results of experimental or observational studies on the effect of nutrients on blood lead levels in pregnancy. Data Extraction Three nurse reviewers extracted data and appraised the studies using tools from the Joanna Briggs Institute. Data Synthesis and Meta-Analysis We included 28 studies from 16 countries. Study authors examined 14 distinct nutrients, with calcium being the most frequent. The metaregression included nine analyses of the effect of calcium on blood lead levels and showed a small but significant inverse relationship. The quality of evidence for the effect of calcium on lead levels was high. Eleven analyses were related to the effect of iron on blood lead levels. The quality of evidence was high, and we found mostly negative associations between iron intake and blood lead levels. The quality of evidence for the remaining nutrients was moderate, with few significant findings. Conclusion Targeted nutritional interventions may be beneficial for pregnant women with current lead exposure or a history of elevated lead levels, particularly those with calcium- or iron-deficient diets. More rigorously designed studies are needed in this area.",0

A systemic review in PubMed and Cochrane Controlled Trials Register was performed for articles on risk factors for IMD in children and adolescents published during a 20-year period (19/09/1998 to 19/09/2018). Inclusion and exclusion criteria were established and applied. The data were meta-analyzed using random-effect model and the results were presented on forest plots separately for each risk factor. We identified 12,559 studies (duplicates removed). Titles, abstracts, and full texts were screened and finally, six studies (five case-control and one cohort study) were included in qualitative synthesis, five in meta-analysis. The median age of meningococcal disease (MD) cases was 72.2 months (0–19 years). Household crowding, smoking exposure, close relationships, and recent respiratory tract infections conferred a more than twofold risk for IMD in exposed individuals compared to controls [overcrowded living OR 2.52 (95% CI 1.75–3.63), exposure to smoke OR 2.10 (95% CI 1.00–4.39), kissing OR 2.00 (95% CI: 1.13–3.51), and recent respiratory tract infection OR 3.13 (95% CI 2.02–4.86)]. Attendance of religious events was associated with a decreased risk [0.47 (95% CI, 0.28–0.79)]. Conclusion: Our review highlights the importance of individual characteristics as risk factors for IMD in childhood and adolescence. Preventive policies may consider individual as well as social-environmental factors to target individuals at risk.",0

Method Systematic review and meta-analysis of observational studies retrieved from five search engines until September 2019, comparing the use of any hormonal contraceptive versus non-hormonal contraceptive use or no use. Primary outcome was consumed suicide, and secondary outcomes were suicidal attempt and ideation. Random effects meta-analyses with the inverse variance method were used to evaluate the effects of exposure over outcomes. Effect was calculated as risk ratio (RR) with their corresponding 95% confidence interval (CI). Risk of bias was assessed with the Newcastle-Otawa Scale. Results There were no randomized controlled trials concerning suicide and hormonal contraceptive use. Only three cohort studies (n = 184,721 women), that evaluated the primary outcome (consumed suicide), were included in the meta-analysis. Hormonal contraceptive use was associated to a higher risk of consumed suicide (RR = 1.36, 95% CI 1.06 to 1.75, P =  0.015, I2 = 0%). There were no secondary outcomes in at least two cohorts. Conclusion This meta-analysis found a positive association between hormonal contraceptive use and consumed suicides. Prior to their use, populations at suicidal risk should be properly evaluated.",0
https://doi.org/10.1136/injuryprev-2019-043619,"Evaluating the impact of penalising the use of mobile phones while driving on road traffic fatalities, serious injuries and mobile phone use: a systematic review","Background A vast literature has demonstrated that using mobile phones while driving increases the risk of road traffic crashes. In response, policy-makers have introduced bans and harsher penalties on using mobile phones while driving. Even though emerging evidence suggests that such measures may reduce mobile phone use and crashes, the literature has not been systematically reviewed and synthesised. Objective To evaluate the impact of penalising mobile phone use while driving on road traffic fatalities, serious injuries and the prevalence of mobile phone use while driving. Methods We employed a comprehensive search strategy using electronic databases, websites, handsearching and other sources to locate studies evaluating legislation on mobile phone use while driving. Randomised controlled trials, interrupted time series’, controlled before–after studies with control(s) not exposed to harsher sanctions and panel data designs were included if they measured the outcomes of fatalities, serious injuries or the prevalence of mobile phone use while driving. Eligible studies were critically appraised. Due to substantial heterogeneity, the results were synthesised narratively. The synthesis structured studies according to the type of legislation and outcome measure. Results Of the 7420 studies retrieved, 32 were included. The evidence on the effects of penalising mobile phone use while driving was weak, and somewhat inconsistent, but pointed to a potential decrease in the prevalence of mobile phone use and fatalities for all-driver primary enforcement hand-held bans and texting bans. Conclusions Preventing fatalities from risky driving practices may be helped by implementing harsher laws that penalise mobile phone use while driving.",0

PURPOSE To establish a model for predicting DKD. DATA SOURCES The derivation cohort was from a meta-analysis. The validation cohort was from a Chinese cohort. STUDY SELECTION Cohort studies that reported risk factors of DKD with their corresponding risk ratios (RRs) in patients with type 2 diabetes were selected. All patients had estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) ≥60 mL/min/1.73 m2 and urinary albumin-to-creatinine ratio (UACR) &amp;lt;30 mg/g at baseline. DATA EXTRACTION Risk factors and their corresponding RRs were extracted. Only risk factors with statistical significance were included in our DKD risk prediction model. DATA SYNTHESIS Twenty cohorts including 41,271 patients with type 2 diabetes were included in our meta-analysis. Age, BMI, smoking, diabetic retinopathy, hemoglobin A1c, systolic blood pressure, HDL cholesterol, triglycerides, UACR, and eGFR were statistically significant. All these risk factors were included in the model except eGFR because of the significant heterogeneity among studies. All risk factors were scored according to their weightings, and the highest score was 37.0. The model was validated in an external cohort with a median follow-up of 2.9 years. A cutoff value of 16 was selected with a sensitivity of 0.847 and a specificity of 0.677. LIMITATIONS There was huge heterogeneity among studies involving eGFR. More evidence is needed to power it as a risk factor of DKD. CONCLUSIONS The DKD risk prediction model consisting of nine risk factors established in this study is a simple tool for detecting patients at high risk of DKD.",0

Novel approaches exploring how to implement Systematic Review (SR) principles and methods for evaluating human health risks from environmental chemical exposures are needed. This paper reports and comments on a conceptual model that was developed as part of a mapping exercise for planning a SR, using aluminium-containing antiperspirants (Al-AP) and female breast cancer risk as a case study. The work explores how knowledge-assembly tools and pathway-oriented thinking developed in systems toxicology can be applied to support problem formulation (PF) in the context of SR. A conceptual model was developed to map out key research questions, working hypotheses, routes of exposure, toxicity pathways and endpoints, and related health outcomes. The model draws on the analytic framework for screening topics of the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force and builds on the concept of a ""source-to-outcome continuum"", integrating knowledge gained from exposure pathway concepts such as the Aggregate Exposure Pathway and Adverse Outcome Pathways. The model can be used as a central decision and prioritization tool for scoping and framing Population, Exposure, Control, Outcome (PECO) questions in a transparent and iterative manner; as a supporting tool to guide the whole SR process; and to lay down the methodological foundation of a SR on the Al-AP breast cancer topic. Logic modelling can be easily combined with systems or pathway-oriented thinking, and allows for a more structured, objective and transparent approach to PF when applying SR methods to the CRA context.",0

We aimed to synthesize available epidemiologic studies to disentangle associations of cholesterol, triglycerides, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), and hyperlipidemia with ovarian cancer risk. We searched PubMed, EMBASE, and Web of Science for eligible studies. A random-effects model was applied for synthesis. Heterogeneity was evaluated by a Chi-squared test for the Cochran Q statistic and the I-squared value. Subgroup analysis was conducted by design, study locale, and ovarian cancer case number. Sensitivity analysis was conducted for studies adjusting for certain covariates or with superior quality. To explore the potential dose-response relationship, we further synthesized effect measures of moderate levels of cholesterol, triglycerides, HDL-C, and LDL-C. Twelve studies (five cohort and seven case-control studies) were included. In primary meta-analysis, the synthesized risk ratio (RRpool) and 95% confidence interval (CI) suggested that high cholesterol was associated with an increased ovarian cancer risk (RRpool 1.22, 95% CI 1.01-1.48, Cochran P value: 0.40, I2: 0.5%). High HDL-C was associated with a lower ovarian cancer risk (RRpool 0.61, 95% CI 0.40-0.94, Cochran P value: 0.06, I2: 63.7%). We obtained nonsignificant associations for other exposures. Subgroup and sensitivity analyses yielded consistent results as the primary analysis. Only cholesterol showed marginally significant association in synthesis using moderate exposure levels (RRpool 1.18, 95% CI 0.99-1.42, Cochran P value: 0.51, I2: 0.0%). Our study suggests that high blood cholesterol is associated with an increased ovarian cancer risk, whereas the etiological significance of other exposures deserves more investigations.",0

Therefore, finding high-quality evidence provides a good opportunity to improve patient care and continue learning.The present study aims to obtain a comprehensive understanding of the physicians' clinical information-seeking behavior.A systematic review was conducted according to the PRISMA guidelines. The Web of Science, PubMed, Scopus, ProQuest, Emerald, Wiley Online Library, Science Direct, Cochrane Library, and Embase databases were systematically searched based on the deﬁned criteria. The inclusion criteria were the original articles in the context of patient care and full-text articles published in English from 2002 to 2017. The articles were reviewed, selected, and analyzed in group discussions.Seventy-three articles met the study criteria. Therapy, diagnosis, and epidemiology ranked the highest ones among physicians' information needs. The mean frequency of questions raised during patient care was varied from 0.18 to 1.5 per patient, and the percentage of questions answered ranged between 22.8 and 93 %. The time taken to find the answers to the questions was between 2 to 32 min. Consultation with colleagues, alongside reviewing journal articles, Internet websites, textbooks, and MEDLINE/PubMed were the most frequently used sources reported in the retrieved articles. Further, common search strategies used by physicians included keywords, Boolean operators, similar medical terms, and advanced search. In addition, lack of time, and information searching skills and the unawareness of accessible sources were the most frequent barriers while easily searching and finding information and summaries and synthesized evidence-based materials mainly facilitated information seeking.Physicians increasingly encounter clinical point-of-care questions. However, the facilitation of accessing online information sources has not enabled the physicians to find answers to many of their questions. Considering the fact that they often refer to colleagues, Internet websites, and databases to find answers, the quality of information should be improved by evaluating the physicians' information-seeking behavior in the first stage, and developing information technology in a point-of-care environment, integrating EHR systems to communicate with colleagues, and accessing databases in the second stage.",0

There is a lack of evidence about how best to achieve reductions in SHS exposure among nonsmoking pregnant women. This work systematically reviews individual or household interventions to reduce pregnant women’s exposure to SHS. Methods MEDLINE, EMBASE, and CINAHL databases were searched from their dates of inception to April 17, 2019. Studies were included if: participants were nonsmoking pregnant women; involved an intervention to reduce SHS exposure or encourage partner quitting; and measured SHS exposure of pregnant women and/or recorded quit rates among partners. The UK National Institute for Health &amp; Care Excellence (NICE) Quality Appraisal checklist was used to determine internal and external validity. Results Nine studies met the inclusion criteria. Educational interventions were primarily targeted at the pregnant woman to change her or others’ behavior, with only two studies involving the partner who smoked. Intervention delivery was mixed, spanning brief discussions through to more involving sessions with role play. The effective interventions involved multiple follow-ups. There was no standardized method of assessing exposure to SHS. Many of the included studies had moderate to high risk of bias. Conclusion There is mixed evidence for interventions aimed at reducing pregnant women’s exposure to SHS, though multi-component interventions seem to be more effective. The effectiveness of family-centered approaches involving creating smoke-free homes alongside partner smoking cessation, perhaps involving pharmacological support and/or financial incentives, should be explored. Implications • Measures to protect nonsmoking pregnant women from SHS tend to place the responsibility for “avoidance” on the woman. • There is little work that seeks to involve the smoking partner or other smokers in protecting pregnant women from SHS. • Interventions to create smoke-free homes and/or smoking partner cessation need to be developed: pharmacological and financial support should be explored.",0
https://doi.org/10.1186/s12885-020-06936-9,Podoplanin is a useful prognostic marker and indicates better differentiation in lung squamous cell cancer patients? A systematic review and meta-analysis,"The CSC (cancer stem cell) markers often indicate poor prognosis and more cell invasion or migration of cancer patients. Podoplanin was assumed as a candidate CSC marker and predict poor prognosis among squamous cancers. Whereas, the prognostic value of podoplanin among lung squamous cancer (LUSC) patients remains controversial. A search of databases including PubMed, Embase and Web of Science was performed. Eligible articles studying the prognostic significance of podoplanin were selected. Odds ratio and HR (hazard ratio) were used to assess the relationships between podoplanin and clinical characteristics, as well as to quantify its prognostic role. The heterogeneity was estimated by I2 Statistic and P values from sensitivity analysis. Begg’s funnel plots were used to estimate possible publication bias. 8 eligible studies containing 725 I-IV LUSC patients were included. Podoplanin expression showed no significant correlations with TNM stage, vascular invasion, lymphatic invasion, lymph node metastasis, pleural metastasis of tumor and gender of patients. However, podoplanin showed significant associations with better differentiation (pooled OR = 2.64, 95% CI 1.53–4.56, P = 0.0005, fixed effect) and better overall survival (HR = 2.14, 95% CI 1.45–3.15, P = 0.0001, fixed effect) and progression-free survival (HR = 1.73, 95% CI: 1.01–2.98, P = 0.05, fixed effect) of LUSC. Funnel plots illustrated no evidence of publication bias in our results. Podoplanin could be a useful prognostic marker and indicates better differentiation for LUSC patients, and the value of PDPN expression as a marker for cancer stem cells in LUSC should be critically evaluated in future studies.",0

We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of epidemiological studies of the association between PCB exposure and the risk of hypertension. Studies were identified by searching PubMed, Embase and Web of Science and by reviewing reference lists. Study-specific risk estimates comparing the highest versus lowest quantile of PCB distribution were combined using random-effects models. We identified 10 cross-sectional studies, 6 cohort studies, and 1 nested case-control study. A pooled excess risk of hypertension was found for total PCBs (OR 1.70, 95% CI 1.28–2.26), dioxin-like (DL)-PCBs (OR 1.46, 1.19–1.79), but not for non-dioxin like (NDL)-PCBs (OR 1.19, 0.81–1.73) comparing the highest with the lowest quartile of the distribution. According to a dose-response meta-analysis, a linear dose-effect relationship was found for total PCBs [OR 2.23 (95% CI: 1.59–3.14) for 1000 ng PCB/g lipid increase]. This positive association remained when stratifying the analyses by study design (cohort vs cross-sectional studies) and population (general population vs high exposed workers/residents). Among single PCB congeners, DL-PCB 105 and 118, and non-DL-PCB138 and 153 were related to hypertension. In conclusion, this meta-analysis suggests that exposure to PCBs, particularly to DL-PCBs, may be a risk factor for hypertension, independently of other risk factors. • Total PCB, especially DL-PCB exposure, was associated with a higher risk of hypertension independently of other risk factors. • A linear dose-effect relationship was found for total PCB serum levels using a dose-response meta-analysis. • The positive association was confirmed when stratifying the analyses by study design and level of exposure. • Odds ratio estimates were similar using different lipid adjustment approaches.",1

Therefore, we performed a meta-analysis to examine the relationship between psychological factors and the risk of incident AF.We systematically searched the PubMed and EMBASE databases from inception to December 2019 to identify eligible studies. The hazard ratios (HRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were pooled by using a random-effects model.A total of 11 cohort studies were included in this meta-analysis. There were 5, 2, 4, and 5 studies examining the association of anxiety, anger, depression, and psychological stress with AF, respectively. In the pooled analysis by a random-effects model, anxiety (HR = 1.10, 95%CI 0.97-1.24; P = .14), anger (HR = 1.08, 95%CI 0.95-1.23; P = .21), depression (HR = 1.15, 95%CI 0.98-1.35; P = .08), and work stress (HR = 1.14, 95%CI 0.98-1.34; P = .09) were not associated with the risk of AF. These results were not changed when we re-performed the analysis using a fixed-effects model.Based on current evidence, no associations were observed for anger, anxiety, and work stress with the risk of AF.",0

However, in application-oriented research in the oil and gas industry they have only drawn attention in the past several years. Their excellent optical, electrical, thermal and mechanical performance make them great candidates for use in oil and gas exploration, drilling, production, and transportation. Combined with the actual requirements for well working fluids, chemical enhanced oil recovery, heavy oil recovery, profile control and water shutoff, tracers, oily wastewater treatment, pipeline corrosion prevention treatment, and tools and apparatus, etc., this paper introduces the behavior in water and toxicity to organisms of graphene and its derivatives in detail, and comprehensively reviews the research progress of graphene materials in the upstream oil and gas industry. Based on this, suggestions were put forward for the future research. This work is useful to the in-depth mechanism research and application scope broadening research in the upstream oil and gas industry.",0
https://doi.org/10.1093/geront/gnaa036,The General Self-Efficacy of Older Adults Receiving Care: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis,"Abstract Background and Objectives General self-efficacy (GSE) encourages health-promoting behaviors in older adults. It is unsurprising then that older adults receiving health care services are reported to have a greater risk of low GSE than older adults who are not. Despite this, there is currently limited evidence investigating whether the effect differs based on the environment in which care is received. This review aims to determine whether the GSE of older adults is affected by the receipt of health care services and whether GSE varies based on the setting in which care is received. Research Design and Methods In accordance with PRISMA guidelines (PROSPERO registration number CRD42018092191), a systematic search was undertaken across 7 databases. Standardized mean differences (SMD) and mean General Self-Efficacy Scale scores, with 95% confidence intervals (CI), were pooled for meta-analysis. Results A total of 40 studies were identified, they consisted of 33 population cohorts that were included in the meta-analysis. Older adults receiving health care services were found to be at greater risk of having lower GSE than those who do not (SMD = −0.62; 95% CI: −0.96 to −0.27, p &amp;lt; .0001). Following identification of sources of heterogeneity, older adults receiving acute inpatient care were more likely to have lower GSE than those receiving care in other health care settings. Discussion and Implications Older adults receiving inpatient care have a greater risk of lower GSE, and consequently, poorer health-promoting behaviors. Further research is recommended that focuses on the GSE of older adults and health outcomes following discharge from inpatient care.",0

Self-management is critical for individuals with epilepsy in order to maintain optimal physical, cognitive, and emotional health. Implementing and adopting a self-management program requires considering many factors at the person, program, and systems levels. We conducted a systematic review of qualitative and mixed-methods studies to identify facilitators and barriers that impact implementation and adoption of self-management programs for adults with epilepsy. Methods We used established systematic review methodologies for qualitative and mixed-methods studies. We included studies addressing facilitators (i.e., factors that aided) or barriers (i.e., factors that impeded) to implementation and adoption of self-management interventions for adults with epilepsy. We conducted a narrative thematic synthesis to identify facilitators and barriers. Results The literature search identified 2700 citations; 13 studies met eligibility criteria. Our synthesis identified five themes that categorize facilitators and barriers to successful implementation epilepsy self-management: (1) relevance , intervention content that facilitates acquisition of self-management skills; (2) personalization , intervention components that account for the individual’s social, physical, and environmental characteristics; (3) intervention components , components and dosing of the intervention; (4) technology considerations , considerations that account for individual’s use, familiarity with, and ownership of technology; and (5) clinician interventionist , role and preparation of the individual who leads intervention. We identified facilitators in 11 of the 13 studies and barriers in 11 of the 13 studies and classified these by social-ecological level (i.e., patient/caregiver, program, site/system). Conclusion Identification of facilitators and barriers at multiple levels provides insight into disease-specific factors that influence implementation and adoption of self-management programs for individuals with epilepsy. Our findings indicate that involving individuals with epilepsy and their caregivers in intervention development, and then tailoring intervention content during the intervention, can help ensure the content is relevant to intervention participants. Our findings also indicate the role of the clinician (i.e., the individual who provides self-management education) is important to intervention implementation, and key issues with clinicians were identified as barriers and opportunities for improvement. Overall, our findings have practical value for those seeking to implement and adopt self-management interventions for epilepsy and other chronic illnesses.

Methods A total of 22 studies with 10,368 patients were included in this review. Hazard ratios were used for analysis, while meta-analysis was performed using the inverse-variance method. Among all physical performance tests reported in the literature, the six-minute walk distance (6MD) test was most frequently used. However, short physical performance battery (SPPB) and walking speed were more frequently used as outcomes among studies investigating patients with a higher mean age. Results The results of our meta-analysis showed that 6MD cut-off values were significantly associated with mortality [hazard ratio (HR), 2.04; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.48–2.83; p  Conclusions Our meta-analysis showed a strong relationship between 6MD and prognosis. However, studies investigating more elderly patients have tended to more frequently utilize walking speed and SPPB as outcomes.",0
